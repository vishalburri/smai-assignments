<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>

<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>

<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>

<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>

<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>

<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>
<s> this interesting little monument having passed with the field in which it was found into other hands has been destroyed <\s>
<s> it is much to be regretted that the striking relic of antiquity at shap has been in a great measure destroyed also <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>

<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>

<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>

<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>

<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>

<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>

<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>

<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>

<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>

<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>

<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>

<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>
<s> this interesting little monument having passed with the field in which it was found into other hands has been destroyed <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>

<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>

<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>

<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>

<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>

<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>

<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>
<s> this interesting little monument having passed with the field in which it was found into other hands has been destroyed <\s>
<s> it is much to be regretted that the striking relic of antiquity at shap has been in a great measure destroyed also <\s>
<s> the daughters of long meg are placed not in an oblong as the stones of shap but in a perfect circle eighty yards in diameter and seventy two in number and from above three yards high to less than so many feet a little way out of the circle stands long meg herself a single stone eighteen feet high <\s>
<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>

<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>

<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>

<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>

<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>

<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>

<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>

<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>

<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>

<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>

<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>

<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
<s> but these objects though pleasing in their forms must necessarily more than others in rural scenery derive their interest from the sentiments of piety and reverence for the modest virtues and simple manners of humble life with which they may be contemplated <\s>
<s> a man must be very insensible who would not be touched with pleasure at the sight of the chapel of buttermere so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size how small must be the congregation there assembled as it were like one family and proclaiming at the same time to the passenger in connection with the surrounding mountains the depth of that seclusion in which the people live that has rendered necessary the building of a separate place of worship for so few <\s>
<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>

<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>

<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>

<s> hitherto i have chiefly spoken of the features by which nature has discriminated this country from others <\s>
<s> i will now describe in general terms in what manner it is indebted to the hand of man <\s>
<s> what i have to notice on this subject will emanate most easily and perspicuously from a description of the ancient and present inhabitants their occupations their condition of life the distribution of landed property among them and the tenure by which it is holden <\s>
<s> the reader will suffer me here to recall to his mind the shapes of the vallies and their position with respect to each other and the forms and substance of the intervening mountains <\s>
<s> he will people the vallies with lakes and rivers the coves and sides of the mountains with pools and torrents and will bound half of the circle which we have contemplated by the sands of the sea or by the sea itself <\s>
<s> he will conceive that from the point upon which he stood he looks down upon this scene before the country had been penetrated by any inhabitants to vary his sensations and to break in upon their stillness he will form to himself an image of the tides visiting and re visiting the friths the main sea dashing against the bolder shore the rivers pursuing their course to be lost in the mighty mass of waters <\s>
<s> he may see or hear in fancy the winds sweeping over the lakes or piping with a loud voice among the mountain peaks and lastly may think of the primeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change <\s>
<s> when the first settlers entered this region says an animated writer they found it overspread with wood forest trees the fir the oak the ash and the birch had skirted the fells tufted the hills and shaded the vallies through centuries of silent solitude the birds and beasts of prey reigned over the meeker species and the bellum inter omnia maintained the balance of nature in the empire of beasts <\s>
<s> such was the state and appearance of this region when the aboriginal colonists of the celtic tribes were first driven or drawn towards it and became joint tenants with the wolf the boar the wild bull the red deer and the leigh a gigantic species of deer which has been long extinct while the inaccessible crags were occupied by the falcon the raven and the eagle <\s>
<s> the inner parts were too secluded and of too little value to participate much of the benefit of roman manners and though these conquerors encouraged the britons to the improvement of their lands in the plain country of furness and cumberland they seem to have had little connexion with the mountains except for military purposes or in subservience to the profit they drew from the mines <\s>
<s> when the romans retired from great britain it is well known that these mountain fastnesses furnished a protection to some unsubdued britons long after the more accessible and more fertile districts had been seized by the saxon or danish invader <\s>
<s> a few though distinct traces of roman forts or camps as at ambleside and upon dunmallet and a few circles of rude stones attributed to the druids 56 are the only vestiges that remain upon the surface of the country of these ancient occupants and as the saxons and danes who succeeded to the possession of the villages and hamlets which had been established by the britons seem at first to have confined themselves to the open country we may descend at once to times long posterior to the conquest by the normans when their feudal polity was regularly established <\s>
<s> we may easily conceive that these narrow dales and mountain sides choaked up as they must have been with wood lying out of the way of communication with other parts of the island and upon the edge of a hostile kingdom could have little attraction for the high born and powerful especially as the more open parts of the country furnished positions for castles and houses of defence sufficient to repel any of those sudden attacks which in the then rude state of military knowledge could be made upon them <\s>
<s> accordingly the more retired regions and to such i am now confining myself must have been neglected or shunned even by the persons whose baronial or signioral rights extended over them and left doubtless partly as a place of refuge for outlaws and robbers and partly granted out for the more settled habitation of a few vassals following the employment of shepherds or woodlanders <\s>
<s> hence these lakes and inner vallies are unadorned by any remains of ancient grandeur castles or monastic edifices which are only found upon the skirts of the country as furness abbey calder abbey the priory of lannercost gleaston castle long ago a residence of the flemings and the numerous ancient castles of the cliffords the lucys and the dacres <\s>
<s> on the southern side of these mountains especially in that part known by the name of furness fells which is more remote from the borders the state of society would necessarily be more settled though it also was fashioned not a little by its neighbourhood to a hostile kingdom <\s>
<s> we will therefore give a sketch of the economy of the abbots in the distribution of lands among their tenants as similar plans were doubtless adopted by other lords and as the consequences have affected the face of the country materially to the present day being in fact one of the principal causes which give it such a striking superiority in beauty and interest over all other parts of the island <\s>
<s> 56 it is not improbable that these circles were once numerous and that many of them may yet endure in a perfect state under no very deep covering of soil <\s>
<s> a friend of the author while making a trench in a level piece of ground not far from the banks of the emont but in no connection with that river met with some stones which seemed to him formally arranged this excited his curiosity and proceeding he uncovered a perfect circle of stones from two to three or four feet high with a sanctum sanctorum the whole a complete place of druidical worship of small dimensions having the same sort of relation to stonehenge long meg and her daughters near the river eden and karl lofts near shap if this last be not danish that a rural chapel bears to a stately church or to one of our noble cathedrals <\s>
<s> this interesting little monument having passed with the field in which it was found into other hands has been destroyed <\s>
<s> it is much to be regretted that the striking relic of antiquity at shap has been in a great measure destroyed also <\s>
<s> the daughters of long meg are placed not in an oblong as the stones of shap but in a perfect circle eighty yards in diameter and seventy two in number and from above three yards high to less than so many feet a little way out of the circle stands long meg herself a single stone eighteen feet high <\s>
<s> when the author first saw this monument he came upon it by surprize therefore might over rate its importance as an object but he must say that though it is not to be compared with stonehenge he has not seen any other remains of those dark ages which can pretend to rival it in singularity and dignity of appearance <\s>
<s> a weight of awe not easy to be borne fell suddenly upon my spirit cast from the dread bosom of the unknown past when first i saw that sisterhood forlorn and her whose strength and stature seem to scorn the power of years pre eminent and placed apart to overlook the circle vast <\s>
<s> tell it to the morn while she dispels the cumbrous shades of night let the moon hear emerging from a cloud when how and wherefore rose on british ground that wondrous monument whose mystic round forth shadows some have deemed to mortal sight the inviolable god that tames the proud <\s>
<s> when the abbots of furness says an author before cited enfranchised their villains and raised them to the dignity of customary tenants the lands which they had cultivated for their lord were divided into whole tenements each of which besides the customary annual rent was charged with the obligation of having in readiness a man completely armed for the king's service on the borders or elsewhere each of these whole tenements was again subdivided into four equal parts each villain had one and the party tenant contributed his share to the support of the man of arms and of other burdens <\s>
<s> these divisions were not properly distinguished the land remained mixed each tenant had a share through all the arable and meadow land and common of pasture over all the wastes <\s>
<s> these sub tenements were judged sufficient for the support of so many families and no further division was permitted <\s>
<s> these divisions and sub divisions were convenient at the time for which they were calculated the land so parcelled out was of necessity more attended to and the industry greater when more persons were to be supported by the produce of it <\s>
<s> the frontier of the kingdom within which furness was considered was in a constant state of attack and defence more hands therefore were necessary to guard the coast to repel an invasion from scotland or make reprisals on the hostile neighbour <\s>
<s> the dividing the lands in such manner as has been shown increased the number of inhabitants and kept them at home till called for and the land being mixed and the several tenants united in equipping the plough the absence of the fourth man was no prejudice to the cultivation of his land which was committed to the care of three <\s>
<s> while the villains of low furness were thus distributed over the land and employed in agriculture those of high furness were charged with the care of flocks and herds to protect them from the wolves which lurked in the thickets and in winter to browze them with the tender sprouts of hollies and ash <\s>
<s> this custom was not till lately discontinued in high furness and holly trees were carefully preserved for that purpose when all other wood was cleared off large tracts of common being so covered with these trees as to have the appearance of a forest of hollies <\s>
<s> at the shepherd's call the flocks surrounded the holly bush and received the croppings at his hand which they greedily nibbled up bleating for more <\s>
<s> the abbots of furness enfranchised these pastoral vassals and permitted them to enclose quillets to their houses for which they paid encroachment rent west's antiquities of furness <\s>
<s> however desirable for the purposes of defence a numerous population might be it was not possible to make at once the same numerous allotments among the untilled vallies and upon the sides of the mountains as had been made in the cultivated plains <\s>
<s> the enfranchised shepherd or woodlander having chosen there his place of residence builds it of sods or of the mountain stone and with the permission of his lord encloses like robinson crusoe a small croft or two immediately at his door for such animals as he wishes to protect <\s>
<s> others are happy to imitate his example and avail themselves of the same privileges and thus a population mainly of danish or norse origin as the dialect indicates crept on towards the more secluded parts of the vallies <\s>
<s> chapels daughters of some distant mother church are first erected in the more open and fertile vales as those of bowness and grasmere offsets of kendal which again after a period as the settled population increases become motherchurches to smaller edifices planted at length in almost every dale throughout the country <\s>
<s> the inclosures formed by the tenantry are for a long time confined to the home steads and the arable and meadow land of the vales is possessed in common field the several portions being marked out by stones bushes or trees which portions where the custom has survived to this day are called dales from the word deylen to distribute but while the valley was thus lying open enclosures seem to have taken place upon the sides of the mountains because the land there was not intermixed and was of little comparative value and therefore small opposition would be made to its being appropriated by those to whose habitations it was contiguous <\s>
<s> hence the singular appearance which the sides of many of these mountains exhibit intersected as they are almost to the summit with stone walls <\s>
<s> when first erected these stone fences must have little disfigured the face of the country as part of the lines would every where be hidden by the quantity of native wood then remaining and the lines would also be broken as they still are by the rocks which interrupt and vary their course <\s>
<s> in the meadows and in those parts of the lower grounds where the soil has not been sufficiently drained and could not afford a stable foundation there when the increasing value of land and the inconvenience suffered from intermixed plots of ground in common field had induced each inhabitant to enclose his own they were compelled to make the fences of alders willows and other trees <\s>
<s> these where the native wood had disappeared have frequently enriched the vallies with a sylvan appearance while the intricate intermixture of property has given to the fences a graceful irregularity which where large properties are prevalent and large capitals employed in agriculture is unknown <\s>
<s> this sylvan appearance is heightened by the number of ash trees planted in rows along the quick fences and along the walls for the purpose of browzing the cattle at the approach of winter <\s>
<s> the branches are lopped off and strewn upon the pastures and when the cattle have stripped them of the leaves they are used for repairing the hedges or for fuel <\s>
<s> we have thus seen a numerous body of dalesmen creeping into possession of their home steads their little crofts their mountain enclosures and finally the whole vale is visibly divided except perhaps here and there some marshy ground which till fully drained would not repay the trouble of enclosing <\s>
<s> but these last partitions do not seem to have been general till long after the pacification of the borders by the union of the two crowns when the cause which had first determined the distribution of land into such small parcels had not only ceased but likewise a general improvement had taken place in the country with a correspondent rise in the value of its produce <\s>
<s> from the time of the union it is certain that this species of feudal population must rapidly have diminished <\s>
<s> that it was formerly much more numerous than it is at present is evident from the multitude of tenements i do not mean houses but small divisions of land which belonged formerly each to a several proprietor and for which separate fines are paid to the manorial lord at this day <\s>
<s> these are often in the proportion of four to one of the present occupants <\s>
<s> sir launcelot threlkeld who lived in the reign of henry vii was wont to say he had three noble houses one for pleasure crosby in westmoreland where he had a park full of deer one for profit and warmth wherein to reside in winter namely yanwith nigh penrith and the third threlkeld on the edge of the vale of keswick well stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars <\s>
<s> but as i have said from the union of the two crowns this numerous vassalage their services not being wanted would rapidly diminish various tenements would be united in one possessor and the aboriginal houses probably little better than hovels like the kraels of savages or the huts of the highlanders of scotland would fall into decay and the places of many be supplied by substantial and comfortable buildings a majority of which remain to this day scattered over the vallies and are often the only dwellings found in them <\s>
<s> from the time of the erection of these houses till within the last sixty years the state of society though no doubt slowly and gradually improving underwent no material change <\s>
<s> corn was grown in these vales through which no carriage road had yet been made sufficient upon each estate to furnish bread for each family and no more notwithstanding the union of several tenements the possessions of each inhabitant still being small in the same field was seen an intermixture of different crops and the plough was interrupted by little rocks mostly overgrown with wood or by spongy places which the tillers of the soil had neither leisure nor capital to convert into firm land <\s>
<s> the storms and moisture of the climate induced them to sprinkle their upland property with outhouses of native stone as places of shelter for their sheep where in tempestuous weather food was distributed to them <\s>
<s> every family spun from its own flock the wool with which it was clothed a weaver was here and there found among them and the rest of their wants was supplied by the produce of the yarn which they carded and spun in their own houses and carried to market either under their arms or more frequently on pack horses a small train taking their way weekly down the valley or over the mountains to the most commodious town <\s>
<s> they had as i have said their rural chapel and of course their minister in clothing or in manner of life in no respect differing from themselves except on the sabbath day this was the sole distinguished individual among them every thing else person and possession exhibited a perfect equality a community of shepherds and agriculturists proprietors for the most part of the lands which they occupied and cultivated <\s>
<s> while the process above detailed was going on the native forest must have been every where receding but trees were planted for the sustenance of the flocks in winter such was then the rude state of agriculture and for the same cause it was necessary that care should be taken of some part of the growth of the native woods <\s>
<s> accordingly in queen elizabeth's time this was so strongly felt that a petition was made to the crown praying that the blomaries in high furness might be abolished on account of the quantity of wood which was consumed in them for the use of the mines to the great detriment of the cattle <\s>
<s> but this same cause about a hundred years after produced effects directly contrary to those which had been deprecated <\s>
<s> the re establishment at that period of furnaces upon a large scale made it the interest of the people to convert the steeper and more stony of the enclosures sprinkled over with remains of the native forest into close woods which when cattle and sheep were excluded rapidly sowed and thickened themselves <\s>
<s> the reader's attention has been directed to the cause by which tufts of wood pasturage meadow and arable land with its various produce are intricately intermingled in the same field and he will now see in like manner how enclosures entirely of wood and those of cultivated ground are blended all over the country under a law of similar wildness <\s>
<s> an historic detail has thus been given of the manner in which the hand of man has acted upon the surface of the inner regions of this mountainous country as incorporated with and subservient to the powers and processes of nature <\s>
<s> we will now take a view of the same agency acting within narrower bounds for the production of the few works of art and accommodations of life which in so simple a state of society could be necessary <\s>
<s> these are merely habitations of man and coverts for beasts roads and bridges and places of worship <\s>
<s> and to begin with the cottages <\s>
<s> they are scattered over the vallies and under the hill sides and on the rocks and even to this day in the more retired dales without any intrusion of more assuming buildings cluster'd like stars some few but single most and lurking dimly in their shy retreats or glancing on each other cheerful looks like separated stars with clouds between ms <\s>
<s> the dwelling houses and contiguous outhouses are in many instances of the colour of the native rock out of which they have been built but frequently the dwelling or fire house as it is ordinarily called has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough cast and white wash which as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it in a few years acquires by the influence of weather a tint at once sober and variegated <\s>
<s> as these houses have been from father to son inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant who being for the most part proprietor was at liberty to follow his own fancy so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of nature and may using a strong expression rather be said to have grown than to have been erected to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock so little is there in them of formality such is their wildness and beauty <\s>
<s> among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow <\s>
<s> it is a favourable circumstance that the strong winds which sweep down the vallies induced the inhabitants at a time when the materials for building were easily procured to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches and such as have not this defence are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds <\s>
<s> nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller <\s>
<s> sometimes a low chimney almost upon a level with the roof is overlaid with a slate supported upon four slender pillars to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney <\s>
<s> others are of a quadrangular shape rising one or two feet above the roof which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen <\s>
<s> nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form and the living column of smoke ascending from it through the still air <\s>
<s> these dwellings mostly built as has been said of rough unhewn stone are roofed with slates which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood and are therefore rough and uneven in their surface so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens mosses ferns and flowers <\s>
<s> hence buildings which in their very form call to mind the processes of nature do thus clothed in part with a vegetable garb appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things as it acts and exists among the woods and fields and by their colour and their shape affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of nature and simplicity along which the humble minded inhabitants have through so many generations been led <\s>
<s> add the little garden with its shed for bee hives its small bed of pot herbs and its borders and patches of flowers for sunday posies with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked an orchard of proportioned size a cheese press often supported by some tree near the door a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade with a tall fir through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons combine these incidents and images together and you have the representative idea of a mountain cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself and so richly adorned by the hand of nature <\s>
<s> till within the last sixty years there was no communication between any of these vales by carriage roads all bulky articles were transported on pack horses <\s>
<s> owing however to the population not being concentrated in villages but scattered the vallies themselves were intersected as now by innumerable lanes and pathways leading from house to house and from field to field <\s>
<s> these lanes where they are fenced by stone walls are mostly bordered with ashes hazels wild roses and beds of tall fern at their base while the walls themselves if old are overspread with mosses small ferns wild strawberries the geranium and lichens and if the wall happen to rest against a bank of earth it is sometimes almost wholly concealed by a rich facing of stone fern <\s>
<s> it is a great advantage to a traveller or resident that these numerous lanes and paths if he be a zealous admirer of nature will lead him on into all the recesses of the country so that the hidden treasures of its landscapes may by an ever ready guide be laid open to his eyes <\s>
<s> likewise to the smallness of the several properties is owing the great number of bridges over the brooks and torrents and the daring and graceful neglect of danger or accommodation with which so many of them are constructed the rudeness of the forms of some and their endless variety <\s>
<s> but when i speak of this rudeness i must at the same time add that many of these structures are in themselves models of elegance as if they had been formed upon principles of the most thoughtful architecture <\s>
<s> it is to be regretted that these monuments of the skill of our ancestors and of that happy instinct by which consummate beauty was produced are disappearing fast but sufficient specimens remain 57 to give a high gratification to the man of genuine taste <\s>
<s> 57 written some time ago <\s>
<s> the injury done since is more than could have been calculated upon <\s>
<s> singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes <\s>
<s> this is in the course of things but why should the genius that directed the ancient architecture of these vales have deserted them <\s>
<s> for the bridges churches mansions cottages and their richly fringed and flat roofed outhouses venerable as the grange of some old abbey have been substituted structures in which baldness only seems to have been studied or plans of the most vulgar utility <\s>
<s> but some improvement may be looked for in future the gentry recently have copied the old models and successful instances might be pointed out if i could take the liberty <\s>
<s> travellers who may not have been accustomed to pay attention to things so inobtrusive will excuse me if i point out the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch the lightness of the parapet and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have nothing further to notice except the places of worship which have mostly a little school house adjoining 58 <\s>
<s> the architecture of these churches and chapels where they have not been recently rebuilt or modernised is of a style not less appropriate and admirable than that of the dwelling houses and other structures <\s>
<s> how sacred the spirit by which our forefathers were directed <\s>
<s> the religio loci is no where violated by these unstinted yet unpretending works of human hands <\s>
<s> they exhibit generally a well proportioned oblong with a suitable porch in some instances a steeple tower and in others nothing more than a small belfry in which one or two bells hang visibly <\s>
