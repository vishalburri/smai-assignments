<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>

<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>

<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>

<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>

<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>

<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>

<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>

<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>

<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>

<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>

<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>

<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>

<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>

<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>

<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>

<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>

<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>

<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>

<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>

<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>

<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>

<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>

<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>

<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>

<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>

<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
<s> yet for my own part without affecting any superior sanctity i must say that i have been better satisfied with myself when in these evidences i have seen a proof how deeply the piety of the rude forefathers of the hamlet is seated in their natures i mean how habitual and constitutional it is and how awful the feeling which they attach to the situation of their departed friends a proof of this rather than of their ignorance or of a deadness in their faculties to a sense of the ridiculous <\s>
<s> and that this deduction may be just is rendered probable by the frequent occurrence of passages according to our present notion full as ludicrous in the writings of the most wise and learned men of former ages divines and poets who in the earnestness of their souls have applied metaphors and illustrations taken either from holy writ or from the usages of their own country in entire confidence that the sacredness of the theme they were discussing would sanctify the meanest object connected with it or rather without ever conceiving it was possible that a ludicrous thought could spring up in any mind engaged in such meditations <\s>
<s> and certainly these odd and fantastic combinations are not confined to epitaphs of the peasantry or of the lower orders of society but are perhaps still more commonly produced among the higher in a degree equally or more striking <\s>
<s> for instance what shall we say to this upon sir george vane the noted secretary of state to king charles i <\s>
<s> his honour wonne i'th field lies here in dust his honour got by grace shall never rust the former fades the latter shall fade never for why <\s>
<s> he was sr george once but st george ever <\s>
<s> the date is 1679 <\s>
<s> when we reflect that the father of this personage must have had his taste formed in the punning court of james i and that the epitaph was composed at a time when our literature was stuffed with quaint or out of the way thoughts it will seem not unlikely that the author prided himself upon what he might call a clever hit i mean his better affections were less occupied with the several associations belonging to the two ideas than his vanity delighted with that act of ingenuity by which they had been combined <\s>
<s> but the first couplet consists of a just thought naturally expressed and i should rather conclude the whole to be a work of honest simplicity and that the sense of worldly dignity associated with the title in a degree habitual to our ancestors but which at this time we can but feebly sympathize with and the imaginative feeling involved viz <\s>
<s> the saintly and chivalrous name of the champion of england were unaffectedly linked together and that both were united and consolidated in the author's mind and in the minds of his contemporaries whom no doubt he had pleased by a devout contemplation of a happy immortality the reward of the just <\s>
<s> at all events leaving this particular case undecided the general propriety of these notices cannot be doubted and i gladly avail myself of this opportunity to place in a clear view the power and majesty of impassioned faith whatever be its object to shew how it subjugates the lighter motions of the mind and sweeps away superficial difference in things <\s>
<s> and this i have done not to lower the witling and the worldling in their own esteem but with a wish to bring the ingenuous into still closer communion with those primary sensations of the human heart which are the vital springs of sublime and pathetic composition in this and in every other kind <\s>
<s> and as from these primary sensations such composition speaks so unless correspondent ones listen promptly and submissively in the inner cell of the mind to whom it is addressed the voice cannot be heard its highest powers are wasted <\s>
<s> these suggestions may be further useful to establish a criterion of sincerity by which a writer may be judged and this is of high import <\s>
<s> for when a man is treating an interesting subject or one which he ought not to treat at all unless he be interested no faults have such a killing power as those which prove that he is not in earnest that he is acting a part has leisure for affectation and feels that without it he could do nothing <\s>
<s> this is one of the most odious of faults because it shocks the moral sense and is worse in a sepulchral inscription precisely in the same degree as that mode of composition calls for sincerity more urgently than any other <\s>
<s> and indeed where the internal evidence proves that the writer was moved in other words where this charm of sincerity lurks in the language of a tomb stone and secretly pervades it there are no errors in style or manner for which it will not be in some degree a recompence but without habits of reflection a test of this inward simplicity cannot be come at and as i have said i am now writing with a hope to assist the well disposed to attain it <\s>
<s> let us take an instance where no one can be at a loss <\s>
<s> the following lines are said to have been written by the illustrious marquis of montrose with the point of his sword upon being informed of the death of his master charles i great good and just could i but rate my griefs and thy so rigid fate i'd weep the world to such a strain as it should deluge once again <\s>
<s> but since thy loud tongued blood demands supplies more from briareus hands than argus eyes i'll sing thy obsequies with trumpets sounds and write thy epitaph with blood and wounds <\s>
<s> these funereal verses would certainly be wholly out of their place upon a tomb stone but who can doubt that the writer was transported to the height of the occasion <\s>
<s> that he was moved as it became an heroic soldier holding those principles and opinions to be moved <\s>
<s> his soul labours the most tremendous event in the history of the planet namely the deluge is brought before his imagination by the physical image of tears a connection awful from its very remoteness and from the slender band that unites the ideas it passes into the region of fable likewise for all modes of existence that forward his purpose are to be pressed into the service <\s>
<s> the whole is instinct with spirit and every word has its separate life like the chariot of the messiah and the wheels of that chariot as they appeared to the imagination of milton aided by that of the prophet ezekiel <\s>
<s> it had power to move of itself but was conveyed by cherubs <\s>
<s> with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between <\s>
<s> compare with the above verses of montrose the following epitaph upon sir philip sidney which was formerly placed over his grave in st <\s>
<s> england netherland the heavens and the arts the soldiers and the world have made six parts of noble sidney for who will suppose that a small heap of stones can sidney enclose <\s>
<s> england hath his body for she it fed netherland his blood in her defence shed the heavens have his soul the arts have his fame the soldiers the grief the world his good name <\s>
<s> there were many points in which the case of sidney resembled that of charles i <\s>
<s> he was a sovereign but of a nobler kind a sovereign in the hearts of men and after his premature death he was truly as he hath been styled the world mourned sidney <\s>
<s> so fondly did the admiration of his contemporaries settle upon him that the sudden removal of a man so good great and thoroughly accomplished wrought upon many even to repining and to the questioning the dispensations of providence <\s>
<s> yet he whom spenser and all the men of genius of his age had tenderly bemoaned is thus commemorated upon his tomb stone and to add to the indignity the memorial is nothing more than the second hand coat of a french commander <\s>
<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>

<s> it is a servile translation from a french epitaph which says weever was by some english wit happily imitated and ingeniously applied to the honour of our worthy chieftain <\s>
<s> yet weever in a foregoing paragraph thus expresses himself upon the same subject giving without his own knowledge in my opinion an example of the manner in which an epitaph ought to have been composed but i cannot pass over in silence sir philip sidney the elder brother being to use camden's words the glorious star of this family a lively pattern of virtue and the lovely joy of all the learned sort who fighting valiantly with the enemy before zutphen in geldesland dyed manfully <\s>
<s> this is that sidney whom as god's will was he should therefore be born into the world even to shew unto our age a sample of ancient virtues so his good pleasure was before any man looked for it to call for him again and take him out of the world as being more worthy of heaven than earth <\s>
<s> thus we may see perfect virtue suddenly vanisheth out of sight and the best men continue not long <\s>
<s> there can be no need to analyse this simple effusion of the moment in order to contrast it with the laboured composition before given the difference will flash upon the reader at once <\s>
<s> but i may say it is not likely that such a frigid composition as the former would have ever been applied to a man whose death had so stirred up the hearts of his contemporaries if it had not been felt that something different from that nature which each man carried in his own breast was in his case requisite and that a certain straining of mind was inseparable from the subject <\s>
<s> accordingly an epitaph is adopted in which the writer had turned from the genuine affections and their self forgetting inspirations to the end that his understanding or the faculty designated by the word head as opposed to heart might curiously construct a fabric to be wondered at <\s>
<s> hyperbole in the language of montrose is a mean instrument made mighty because wielded by an afflicted soul and strangeness is here the order of nature <\s>
<s> montrose stretched after remote things but was at the same time propelled towards them the french writer goes deliberately in search of them no wonder then if what he brings home does not prove worth the carriage <\s>
<s> let us return to an instance of common life <\s>
<s> i quote it with reluctance not so much for its absurdity as that the expression in one place will strike at first sight as little less than impious and it is indeed though unintentionally so most irreverent <\s>
<s> but i know no other example that will so forcibly illustrate the important truth i wish to establish <\s>
<s> the following epitaph is to be found in a church yard in westmoreland which the present writer has reason to think of with interest as it contains the remains of some of his ancestors and kindred <\s>
<s> the date is 1678 <\s>
<s> under this stone reader inter'd doth lye beauty and virtue's true epitomy <\s>
<s> at her appearance the noone son blush'd and shrunk in cause quite outdon <\s>
<s> in her concentered did all graces dwell god pluck'd my rose that he might take a smel <\s>
<s> i'll say no more but weeping wish i may soone with thy dear chaste ashes com to lay <\s>
<s> can anything go beyond this in extravagance <\s>
<s> yet if the fundamental thoughts be translated into a natural style they will be found reasonable and affecting 'the woman who lies here interred was in my eyes a perfect image of beauty and virtue she was to me a brighter object than the sun in heaven god took her who was my delight from this earth to bring her nearer to himself <\s>
<s> nothing further is worthy to be said than that weeping i wish soon to lie by thy dear chaste ashes <\s>
<s> thus did the husband pour out his tears <\s>
<s> these verses are preceded by a brief account of the lady in latin prose in which the little that is said is the uncorrupted language of affection <\s>
<s> but without this introductory communication i should myself have had no doubt after recovering from the first shock of surprize and disapprobation that this man notwithstanding his extravagant expressions was a sincere mourner and that his heart during the very act of composition was moved <\s>
<s> these fantastic images though they stain the writing stained not her soul they did not even touch it but hung like globules of rain suspended above a green leaf along which they may roll and leave no trace that they have passed over it <\s>
<s> this simple hearted man must have been betrayed by a common notion that what was natural in prose would be out of place in verse that it is not the muse which puts on the garb but the garb which makes the muse <\s>
<s> and having adopted this notion at a time when vicious writings of this kind accorded with the public taste it is probable that in the excess of his modesty the blankness of his inexperience and the intensity of his affection he thought that the further he wandered from nature in his language the more would he honour his departed consort who now appeared to him to have surpassed humanity in the excellence of her endowments <\s>
<s> the quality of his fault and its very excess are both in favour of this conclusion <\s>
<s> let us contrast this epitaph with one taken from a celebrated writer of the last century <\s>
<s> to the memory of lucy lyttleton daughter c <\s>
<s> who departed this life c <\s>
<s> aged 20 having employed the short time assigned to her here in the uniform practice of religion and virtue <\s>
<s> made to engage all hearts and charm all eyes though meek magnanimous though witty wise polite as all her life in courts had been yet good as she the world had never seen the noble fire of an exalted mind with gentle female tenderness combined <\s>
<s> her speech was the melodious voice of love her song the warbling of the vernal grove her eloquence was sweeter than her song soft as her heart and as her reason strong her form each beauty of the mind express'd her mind was virtue by the graces drest <\s>
<s> the prose part of this inscription has the appearance of being intended for a tomb stone but there is nothing in the verse that would suggest such a thought <\s>
<s> the composition is in the style of those laboured portraits in words which we sometimes see placed at the bottom of a print to fill up lines of expression which the bungling artist had left imperfect <\s>
<s> we know from other evidence that lord lyttleton dearly loved his wife he has indeed composed a monody to her memory which proves this and she was an amiable woman neither of which facts could have been gathered from these inscriptive verses <\s>
<s> this epitaph would derive little advantage from being translated into another style as the former was for there is no under current no skeleton or staminae of thought and feeling <\s>
<s> the reader will perceive at once that nothing in the heart of the writer had determined either the choice the order or the expression of the ideas that there is no interchange of action from within and from without that the connections are mechanical and arbitrary and the lowest kind of these heart and eyes petty alliterations as meek and magnanimous witty and wise combined with oppositions in thoughts where there is no necessary or natural opposition <\s>
<s> then follow voice song eloquence form mind each enumerated by a separate act as if the author had been making a catalogue raisonn ?? <\s>
<s> these defects run through the whole the only tolerable verse is her speech was the melodious voice of love <\s>
<s> observe the question is not which of these epitaphs is better or worse but which faults are of a worse kind <\s>
<s> in the former case we have a mourner whose soul is occupied by grief and urged forward by his admiration <\s>
<s> he deems in his simplicity that no hyperbole can transcend the perfections of her whom he has lost for the version which i have given fairly demonstrates that in spite of his outrageous expressions the under current of his thoughts was natural and pure <\s>
<s> we have therefore in him the example of a mind during the act of composition misled by false taste to the highest possible degree and in that of lord lyttleton we have one of a feeling heart not merely misled but wholly laid asleep by the same power <\s>
<s> lord lyttleton could not have written in this way upon such a subject if he had not been seduced by the example of pope whose sparkling and tuneful manner had bewitched the men of letters his contemporaries and corrupted the judgment of the nation through all ranks of society <\s>
<s> so that a great portion of original genius was necessary to embolden a man to write faithfully to nature upon any affecting subject if it belonged to a class of composition in which pope had furnished examples <\s>
<s> i am anxious not to be misunderstood <\s>
<s> it has already been stated that in this species of composition above every other our sensations and judgments depend upon our opinion or feeling of the author's state of mind <\s>
<s> literature is here so far identified with morals the quality of the act so far determined by our notion of the aim and purpose of the agent that nothing can please us however well executed in its kind if we are persuaded that the primary virtues of sincerity earnestness and a moral interest in the main object are wanting <\s>
<s> insensibility here shocks us and still more so if manifested by a writer going wholly out of his way in search of supposed beauties which if he were truly moved he could set no value upon could not even think of <\s>
<s> we are struck in this case not merely with a sense of disproportion and unfitness but we cannot refrain from attributing no small part of his intellectual to a moral demerit <\s>
<s> and here the difficulties of the question begin namely in ascertaining what errors in the choice of or the mode of expressing the thoughts most surely indicate the want of that which is most indispensible <\s>
<s> bad taste whatever shape it may put on is injurious to the heart and the understanding <\s>
<s> if a man attaches much interest to the faculty of taste as it exists in himself and employs much time in those studies of which this faculty i use the word taste in its comprehensive though most unjustifiable sense is reckoned the arbiter certain it is his moral notions and dispositions must either be purified and strengthened or corrupted and impaired <\s>
<s> how can it be otherwise when his ability to enter into the spirit of works in literature must depend upon his feelings his imagination and his understanding that is upon his recipient upon his creative or active and upon his judging powers and upon the accuracy and compass of his knowledge in fine upon all that makes up the moral and intellectual man <\s>
<s> what is true of individuals is equally true of nations <\s>
<s> nevertheless a man called to a task in which he is not practised may have his expression thoroughly defiled and clogged by the style prevalent in his age yet still through the force of circumstances that have roused him his under feeling may remain strong and pure yet this may be wholly concealed from common view <\s>
<s> indeed the favourite style of different ages is so different and wanders so far from propriety that if it were not that first rate writers in all nations and tongues are governed by common principles we might suppose that truth and nature were things not to be looked for in books hence to an unpractised reader the productions of every age will present obstacles in various degrees hard to surmount a deformity of style not the worst in itself but of that kind with which he is least familiar will on the one hand be most likely to render him insensible to a pith and power which may be within and on the other hand he will be the least able to see through that sort of falsehood which is most prevalent in the works of his own time <\s>
<s> many of my readers to apply these general observations to the present case must have derived pleasure from the epitaph of lord lyttleton and no doubt will be startled at the comparison i have made but bring it to the test recommended it will then be found that its faults though not in degree so intolerable are in kind more radical and deadly than those of the strange composition with which it has been compared <\s>
<s> the course which we have taken having brought us to the name of this distinguished writer pope i will in this place give a few observations upon his epitaphs the largest collection we have in our language from the pen of any writer of eminence <\s>
<s> as the epitaphs of pope and also those of chiabrera which occasioned this dissertation are in metre it may be proper here to enquire how far the notion of a perfect epitaph as given in a former paper may be modified by the choice of metre for the vehicle in preference to prose <\s>
<s> if our opinions be just it is manifest that the basis must remain the same in either case and that the difference can only lie in the superstructure and it is equally plain that a judicious man will be less disposed in this case than in any other to avail himself of the liberty given by metre to adopt phrases of fancy or to enter into the more remote regions of illustrative imagery <\s>
<s> for the occasion of writing an epitaph is matter of fact in its intensity and forbids more authoritatively than any other species of composition all modes of fiction except those which the very strength of passion has created which have been acknowledged by the human heart and have become so familiar that they are converted into substantial realities <\s>
<s> when i come to the epitaphs of chiabrera i shall perhaps give instances in which i think he has not written under the impression of this truth where the poetic imagery does not elevate deepen or refine the human passion which it ought always to do or not to act at all but excludes it <\s>
<s> in a far greater degree are pope's epitaphs debased by faults into which he could not i think have fallen if he had written in prose as a plain man and not as a metrical wit <\s>
<s> i will transcribe from pope's epitaphs the one upon mrs <\s>
