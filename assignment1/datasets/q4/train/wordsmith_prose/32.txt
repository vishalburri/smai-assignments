<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given <\s>
<s> an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred <\s>
<s> this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed <\s>
<s> bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the well being of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed <\s>
<s> observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger <\s>
<s> balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago <\s>
<s> the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this person's acknowledgment <\s>
<s> he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest <\s>
<s> here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits <\s>
<s> urbina his birth place might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare <\s>
<s> this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned <\s>
<s> if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabrera's epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavish an inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestors had omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just <\s>

<s> the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind <\s>

<s> i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her <\s>
<s> this is a searching thought but wholly out of place <\s>
<s> had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just <\s>
<s> the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mother's prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her <\s>
<s> but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant <\s>
<s> but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children <\s>
<s> what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness <\s>
<s> does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted <\s>
<s> and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment <\s>
<s> a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died <\s>

<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>

<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>
<s> the bird of dawn did never rouse this cottager from sleep with startling summons not for his delight the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him murmured the labouring bee <\s>
<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>
<s> the dark winter night the stormy day had each its own resource song of the muses sage historic tale science severe or word of holy writ announcing immortality and joy to the assembled spirits of the just from imperfection and decay secure thus soothed at home thus busy in the field to no perverse suspicion he gave way no languour peevishness nor vain complaint <\s>
<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>

<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given <\s>
<s> an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred <\s>
<s> this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed <\s>
<s> bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the well being of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed <\s>
<s> observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger <\s>
<s> balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago <\s>
<s> the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this person's acknowledgment <\s>
<s> he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest <\s>
<s> here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits <\s>
<s> urbina his birth place might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare <\s>
<s> this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned <\s>
<s> if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabrera's epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavish an inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestors had omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just <\s>

<s> the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind <\s>

<s> i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her <\s>
<s> this is a searching thought but wholly out of place <\s>
<s> had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just <\s>
<s> the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mother's prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her <\s>
<s> but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant <\s>
<s> but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children <\s>
<s> what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness <\s>
<s> does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted <\s>
<s> and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment <\s>
<s> a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died <\s>

<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>

<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>
<s> the bird of dawn did never rouse this cottager from sleep with startling summons not for his delight the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him murmured the labouring bee <\s>
<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>
<s> the dark winter night the stormy day had each its own resource song of the muses sage historic tale science severe or word of holy writ announcing immortality and joy to the assembled spirits of the just from imperfection and decay secure thus soothed at home thus busy in the field to no perverse suspicion he gave way no languour peevishness nor vain complaint <\s>
<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>

<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given <\s>
<s> an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred <\s>
<s> this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed <\s>
<s> bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the well being of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed <\s>
<s> observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger <\s>
<s> balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago <\s>
<s> the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this person's acknowledgment <\s>
<s> he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest <\s>
<s> here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits <\s>
<s> urbina his birth place might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare <\s>
<s> this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned <\s>
<s> if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabrera's epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavish an inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestors had omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just <\s>

<s> the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind <\s>

<s> i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her <\s>
<s> this is a searching thought but wholly out of place <\s>
<s> had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just <\s>
<s> the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mother's prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her <\s>
<s> but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant <\s>
<s> but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children <\s>
<s> what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness <\s>
<s> does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted <\s>
<s> and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment <\s>
<s> a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died <\s>

<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>

<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>
<s> the bird of dawn did never rouse this cottager from sleep with startling summons not for his delight the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him murmured the labouring bee <\s>
<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>
<s> the dark winter night the stormy day had each its own resource song of the muses sage historic tale science severe or word of holy writ announcing immortality and joy to the assembled spirits of the just from imperfection and decay secure thus soothed at home thus busy in the field to no perverse suspicion he gave way no languour peevishness nor vain complaint <\s>
<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>

<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given <\s>
<s> an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred <\s>
<s> this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed <\s>
<s> bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the well being of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed <\s>
<s> observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger <\s>
<s> balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago <\s>
<s> the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this person's acknowledgment <\s>
<s> he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest <\s>
<s> here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits <\s>
<s> urbina his birth place might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare <\s>
<s> this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned <\s>
<s> if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabrera's epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavish an inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestors had omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just <\s>

<s> the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind <\s>

<s> i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her <\s>
<s> this is a searching thought but wholly out of place <\s>
<s> had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just <\s>
<s> the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mother's prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her <\s>
<s> but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant <\s>
<s> but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children <\s>
<s> what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness <\s>
<s> does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted <\s>
<s> and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment <\s>
<s> a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died <\s>

<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>

<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>
<s> the bird of dawn did never rouse this cottager from sleep with startling summons not for his delight the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him murmured the labouring bee <\s>
<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>
<s> the dark winter night the stormy day had each its own resource song of the muses sage historic tale science severe or word of holy writ announcing immortality and joy to the assembled spirits of the just from imperfection and decay secure thus soothed at home thus busy in the field to no perverse suspicion he gave way no languour peevishness nor vain complaint <\s>
<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>

<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> having been engaged so long in the ungracious office of sitting in judgment where i have found so much more to censure than to approve though wherever it was in my power i have placed good by the side of evil that the reader might intuitively receive the truths which i wished to communicate i now turn back with pleasure to chiabrera of whose productions in this department the reader of the friend may be enabled to form a judgment who has attentively perused the few specimens only which have been given <\s>
<s> an epitaph says weever is a superscription either in verse or prose or an astrict pithic diagram writ carved or engraven upon the tomb grave or sepulchre of the defunct briefly declaring and that with a kind of commiseration the name the age the deserts the dignities the state the praises both of body and minde the good and bad fortunes in the life and the manner and time of the death of the person therein interred <\s>
<s> this account of an epitaph which as far as it goes is just was no doubt taken by weever from the monuments of our own country and it shews that in his conception an epitaph was not to be an abstract character of the deceased but an epitomized biography blended with description by which an impression of the character was to be conveyed <\s>
<s> bring forward the one incidental expression a kind of commiseration unite with it a concern on the part of the dead for the well being of the living made known by exhortation and admonition and let this commiseration and concern pervade and brood over the whole so that what was peculiar to the individual shall still be subordinate to a sense of what he had in common with the species our notion of a perfect epitaph would then be realized and it pleases me to say that this is the very model upon which those of chiabrera are for the most part framed <\s>
<s> observe how exquisitely this is exemplified in the one beginning pause courteous stranger <\s>
<s> balbi supplicates given in the friend some weeks ago <\s>
<s> the subject of the epitaph is introduced intreating not directly in his own person but through the mouth of the author that according to the religious belief of his country a prayer for his soul might be preferred to the redeemer of the world placed in counterpoize with this right which he has in common with all the dead his individual earthly accomplishments appear light to his funeral biographer as they did to the person of whom he speaks when alive nor could chiabrera have ventured to touch upon them but under the sanction of this person's acknowledgment <\s>
<s> he then goes on to say how various and profound was his learning and how deep a hold it took upon his affections but that he weaned himself from these things as vanities and was devoted in later life exclusively to the divine truths of the gospel as the only knowledge in which he could find perfect rest <\s>
<s> here we are thrown back upon the introductory supplication and made to feel its especial propriety in this case his life was long and every part of it bore appropriate fruits <\s>
<s> urbina his birth place might be proud of him and the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish breathed for his welfare <\s>
<s> this composition is a perfect whole there is nothing arbitrary or mechanical but it is an organized body of which the members are bound together by a common life and are all justly proportioned <\s>
<s> if i had not gone so much into detail i should have given further instances of chiabrera's epitaphs but i must content myself with saying that if he had abstained from the introduction of heathen mythology of which he is lavish an inexcusable fault for an inhabitant of a christian country yet admitting of some palliation in an italian who treads classic soil and has before his eyes the ruins of the temples which were dedicated to those fictitious beings of objects of worship by the majestic people his ancestors had omitted also some uncharacteristic particulars and had not on some occasions forgotten that truth is the soul of passion he would have left his readers little to regret <\s>
<s> i do not mean to say that higher and nobler thoughts may not be found in sepulchral inscriptions than his contain but he understood his work the principles upon which he composed are just <\s>

<s> the latter part of the following by gray is almost the only instance among the metrical epitaphs in our language of the last century which i remember of affecting thoughts rising naturally and keeping themselves pure from vicious diction and therefore retaining their appropriate power over the mind <\s>

<s> i allude to the conclusion of the epitaph upon his mother where he says she was the careful tender mother of many children one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her <\s>
<s> this is a searching thought but wholly out of place <\s>
<s> had it been said of an idiot of a palsied child or of an adult from any cause dependent upon his mother to a degree of helplessness which nothing but maternal tenderness and watchfulness could answer that he had the misfortune to survive his mother the thought would have been just <\s>
<s> the same might also have been wrung from any man thinking of himself when his soul was smitten with compunction or remorse through the consciousness of a misdeed from which he might have been preserved as he hopes or believes by his mother's prudence by her anxious care if longer continued or by the reverential fear of offending or disobeying her <\s>
<s> but even then unless accompanied with a detail of extraordinary circumstances if transferred to her monument it would have been misplaced as being too peculiar and for reasons which have been before alleged namely as too transitory and poignant <\s>
<s> but in an ordinary case for a man permanently and conspicuously to record that this was his fixed feeling what is it but to run counter to the course of nature which has made it matter of expectation and congratulation that parents should die before their children <\s>
<s> what is it if searched to the bottom but lurking and sickly selfishness <\s>
<s> does not the regret include a wish that the mother should have survived all her offspring have witnessed that bitter desolation where the order of things is disturbed and inverted <\s>
<s> and finally does it not withdraw the attention of the reader from the subject to the author of the memorial as one to be commiserated for his strangely unhappy condition or to be condemned for the morbid constitution of his feelings or for his deficiency in judgment <\s>
<s> a fault of the same kind though less in degree is found in the epitaph of pope upon harcourt of whom it is said that he never gave his father grief but when he died <\s>

<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>

<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>
<s> the bird of dawn did never rouse this cottager from sleep with startling summons not for his delight the vernal cuckoo shouted not for him murmured the labouring bee <\s>
<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>
<s> the dark winter night the stormy day had each its own resource song of the muses sage historic tale science severe or word of holy writ announcing immortality and joy to the assembled spirits of the just from imperfection and decay secure thus soothed at home thus busy in the field to no perverse suspicion he gave way no languour peevishness nor vain complaint <\s>
<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>

<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>

<s> dust are our hopes i weeping did inscribe in bitterness thy monument and pray of every gentle spirit bitterly to read the record with as copious tears <\s>
<s> this epitaph is not without some tender thoughts but a comparison of it with the one upon the youthful pozzobonelli see friend no .... will more clearly shew that chiabrera has here neglected to ascertain whether the passions expressed were in kind and degree a dispensation of reason or at least commodities issued under her licence and authority <\s>
<s> the epitaphs of chiabrera are twenty nine in number all of them save two probably little known at this day in their own country and scarcely at all beyond the limits of it and the reader is generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the course of their lives or a selection of events and circumstances and thus they are individualized but in the two other instances namely those of tasso and raphael he enters into no particulars but contents himself with four lines expressing one sentiment upon the principle laid down in the former part of this discourse where the subject of an epitaph is a man of prime note <\s>
<s> torquato tasso rests within this tomb this figure weeping from her inmost heart is poesy from such impassioned grief let every one conclude what this man was <\s>
<s> the epitaph which chiabrera composed for himself has also an appropriate brevity and is distinguished for its grandeur the sentiment being the same as that which the reader has before seen so happily enlarged upon <\s>
<s> as i am brought back to men of first rate distinction and public benefactors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the metrical part of an epitaph which formerly was inscribed in the church of st <\s>
<s> paul's to that bishop of london who prevailed with william the conqueror to secure to the inhabitants of the city all the liberties and privileges which they had enjoyed in the time of edward the confessor <\s>
<s> these marble monuments to thee thy citizens assigne rewards o father farre unfit to those deserts of thine thee unto them a faithful friend thy london people found and to this towne of no small weight a stay both sure and sound <\s>
<s> their liberties restorde to them by means of thee have beene their publicke weale by means of thee large gifts have felt and seene thy riches stocke and beauty brave one hour hath them supprest yet these thy virtues and good deeds with us for ever rest <\s>
<s> thus have i attempted to determine what a sepulchral inscription ought to be and taken at the same time a survey of what epitaphs are good and bad and have shewn to what deficiencies in sensibility and to what errors in taste and judgement most commonly are to be ascribed <\s>
<s> it was my intention to have given a few specimens from those of the ancients but i have already i fear taken up too much of the reader's time <\s>
<s> i have not animadverted upon such alas <\s>
<s> far too numerous as are reprehensible from the want of moral rectitude in those who have composed them or given it to be understood that they should he so composed boastful and haughty panegyrics ludicrously contradicting the solid remembrance of those who knew the deceased shocking the common sense of mankind by their extravagance and affronting the very altar with their impious falsehood <\s>
<s> those i leave to general scorn not however without a general recommendation that they who have offended or may be disposed to offend in this manner would take into serious thought the heinousness of their transgression <\s>
<s> upon reviewing what has been written i think it better here to add a few favourable specimens such as are ordinarily found in our country church yards at this day <\s>
<s> if those primary sensations upon which i have dwelt so much be not stifled in the heart of the reader they will be read with pleasure otherwise neither these nor more exalted strains can by him be truly interpreted <\s>

<s> not more with silver hairs than virtue crown'd the good old pair take up this spot of ground tread in their steps and you will surely find their rest above below their peace of mind <\s>

<s> in an obscure corner of a country church yard i once espied half overgrown with hemlock and nettles a very small stone laid upon the ground bearing nothing more than the name of the deceased with the date of birth and death importing that it was an infant which had been born one day and died the following <\s>
<s> i know not how far the reader may be in sympathy with me but more awful thoughts of rights conferred of hopes awakened of remembrances stealing away or vanishing were imparted to my mind by that inscription there before my eyes than by any other that it has ever been my lot to meet with upon a tomb stone <\s>
<s> the most numerous class of sepulchral inscriptions do indeed record nothing else but the name of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another <\s>
<s> addison in the spectator making this observation says that he cannot look upon those registers of existence whether of brass or marble but as a kind of satire upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them than that they were born and that they died <\s>
<s> in certain moods of mind this is a natural reflection yet not perhaps the most salutary which the appearance might give birth to <\s>
<s> as in these registers the name is mostly associated with others of the same family this is a prolonged companionship however shadowy even a tomb like this is a shrine to which the fancies of a scattered family may return in pilgrimage the thoughts of the individuals without any communication with each other must oftentimes meet here <\s>
<s> such a frail memorial then is not without its tendency to keep families together <\s>
<s> it feeds also local attachment which is the tap root of the tree of patriotism <\s>
<s> i know not how i can withdraw more satisfactorily from this long disquisition than by offering to the reader as a farewell memorial the following verses suggested to me by a concise epitaph which i met with some time ago in one of the most retired vales among the mountains of westmoreland <\s>
<s> there is nothing in the detail of the poem which is not either founded upon the epitaph or gathered from enquiries concerning the deceased made in the neighbourhood <\s>
<s> beneath that pine which rears its dusky head aloft and covered by a plain blue stone briefly inscribed a gentle dalesman lies from whom in early childhood was withdrawn the precious gift of hearing <\s>
<s> he grew up from year to year in loneliness of soul and this deep mountain valley was to him soundless with all its streams <\s>

<s> when stormy winds were working the broad bosom of the lake into a thousand thousand sparkling waves rocking the trees or driving cloud on cloud along the sharp edge of yon lofty crags the agitated scene before his eye was silent as a picture evermore were all things silent wheresoe'er he moved <\s>
<s> yet by the solace of his own calm thoughts upheld he duteously pursued the round of rural labours the steep mountain side ascended with his staff and faithful dog the plough he guided and the scythe he swayed and the ripe corn before his sickle fell among the jocund reapers <\s>
<s> for himself all watchful and industrious as he was he wrought not neither field nor flock he owned no wish for wealth had place within his mind no husband's love nor father's hope or care though born a younger brother need was none that from the floor of his paternal home he should depart to plant himself anew and when mature in manhood he beheld his parents laid in earth no loss ensued of rights to him but he remained well pleased by the pure bond of independent love an inmate of a second family the fellow labourer and friend of him to whom the small inheritance had fallen <\s>
<s> nor deem that his mild presence was a weight that pressed upon his brother's house for books were ready comrades whom he could not tire of whose society the blameless man was never satiate their familiar voice even to old age with unabated charm beguiled his leisure hours refreshed his thoughts beyond its natural elevation raised his introverted spirit and bestowed upon his life an outward dignity which all acknowledged <\s>

<s> and they who were about him did not fail in reverence or in courtesy they prized his gentle manners and his peaceful smiles the gleams of his slow varying countenance were met with answering sympathy and love <\s>
<s> at length when sixty years and five were told a slow disease insensibly consumed the powers of nature and a few short steps of friends and kindred bore him from his home yon cottage shaded by the woody cross to the profounder stillness of the grave <\s>
