<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>

<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>

<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>

<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>

<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>

<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>

<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>

<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>

<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>

<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>

<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>

<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>

<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>

<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>

<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>

<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>

<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>

<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
<s> on the sides of bleak and desolate moors we are indeed thankful for the sight of white cottages and white houses plentifully scattered where without these perhaps every thing would be cheerless this is said however with hesitation and with a wilful sacrifice of some higher enjoyments <\s>
<s> but i have certainly seen such buildings glittering at sun rise and in wandering lights with no common pleasure <\s>
<s> the continental traveller also will remember that the convents hanging from the rocks of the rhine the rhone the danube or among the appenines or the mountains of spain are not looked at with less complacency when as is often the case they happen to be of a brilliant white <\s>
<s> but this is perhaps owing in no small degree to the contrast of that lively colour with the gloom of monastic life and to the general want of rural residences of smiling and attractive appearance in those countries <\s>
<s> the objections to white as a colour in large spots or masses in landscape especially in a mountainous country are insurmountable <\s>
<s> in nature pure white is scarcely ever found but in small objects such as flowers or in those which are transitory as the clouds foam of rivers and snow <\s>
<s> gilpin who notices this has also recorded the just remark of mr <\s>
<s> locke of n that white destroys the gradations of distance and therefore an object of pure white can scarcely ever be managed with good effect in landscape painting <\s>
<s> five or six white houses scattered over a valley by their obtrusiveness dot the surface and divide it into triangles or other mathematical figures haunting the eye and disturbing that repose which might otherwise be perfect <\s>
<s> i have seen a single white house materially impair the majesty of a mountain cutting away by a harsh separation the whole of its base below the point on which the house stood <\s>
<s> thus was the apparent size of the mountain reduced not by the interposition of another object in a manner to call forth the imagination which will give more than the eye loses but what had been abstracted in this case was left visible and the mountain appeared to take its beginning or to rise from the line of the house instead of its own natural base <\s>
<s> but if i may express my own individual feeling it is after sunset at the coming on of twilight that white objects are most to be complained of <\s>
<s> the solemnity and quietness of nature at that time are always marred and often destroyed by them <\s>
<s> when the ground is covered with snow they are of course inoffensive and in moonshine they are always pleasing it is a tone of light with which they accord and the dimness of the scene is enlivened by an object at once conspicuous and cheerful <\s>
<s> i will conclude this subject with noticing that the cold slaty colour which many persons who have heard the white condemned have adopted in its stead must be disapproved of for the reason already given <\s>
<s> the flaring yellow runs into the opposite extreme and is still more censurable <\s>
<s> upon the whole the safest colour for general use is something between a cream and a dust colour commonly called stone colour there are among the lakes examples of this that need not be pointed out 61 61 a proper colouring of houses is now becoming general <\s>
<s> it is best that the colouring material should be mixed with the rough cast and not laid on as a wash afterwards <\s>
<s> the principle taken as our guide viz <\s>
<s> that the house should be so formed and of such apparent size and colour as to admit of its being gently incorporated with the works of nature should also be applied to the management of the grounds and plantations and is here more urgently needed for it is from abuses in this department far more even than from the introduction of exotics in architecture if the phrase may be used that this country has suffered <\s>
<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>

<s> larch and fir plantations have been spread not merely with a view to profit but in many instances for the sake of ornament <\s>
<s> to those who plant for profit and are thrusting every other tree out of the way to make room for their favourite the larch i would utter first a regret that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory when there is so much barren and irreclaimable land in the neighbouring moors and in other parts of the island which might have been had for this purpose at a far cheaper rate <\s>
<s> and i will also beg leave to represent to them that they ought not to be carried away by flattering promises from the speedy growth of this tree because in rich soils and sheltered situations the wood though it thrives fast is full of sap and of little value and is likewise very subject to ravage from the attacks of insects and from blight <\s>
<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>

<s> accordingly in scotland where planting is much better understood and carried on upon an incomparably larger scale than among us good soil and sheltered situations are appropriated to the oak the ash and other deciduous trees and the larch is now generally confined to barren and exposed ground <\s>
<s> there the plant which is a hardy one is of slower growth much less liable to injury and the timber is of better quality <\s>
<s> but the circumstances of many permit and their taste leads them to plant with little regard to profit and there are others less wealthy who have such a lively feeling of the native beauty of these scenes that they are laudably not unwilling to make some sacrifices to heighten it <\s>
<s> both these classes of persons i would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists <\s>
<s> they would then see that after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs which from the circumstance of their not being native may by their very looks remind us that they owe their existence to our hands and their prosperity to our care they will see that after this natural desire has been provided for the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place <\s>
<s> before i proceed i will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency when they are so eager to change the face of that country whose native attractions by the act of erecting their habitations in it they have so emphatically acknowledged <\s>
<s> and surely there is not a single spot that would not have if well managed sufficient dignity to support itself unaided by the productions of other climates or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming elsewhere <\s>
<s> having adverted to the feelings that justify the introduction of a few exotic plants provided they be confined almost to the doors of the house we may add that a transition should be contrived without abruptness from these foreigners to the rest of the shrubs which ought to be of the kinds scattered by nature through the woods holly broom wild rose elder dogberry white and black thorn c either these only or such as are carefully selected in consequence of their being united in form and harmonising in colour with them especially with respect to colour when the tints are most diversified as in autumn and spring <\s>
<s> the various sorts of fruit and blossom bearing trees usually found in orchards to which may be added those of the woods namely the wilding black cherry tree and wild cluster cherry here called heck berry may be happily admitted as an intermediate link between the shrubs and the forest trees which last ought almost entirely to be such as are natives of the country <\s>
<s> of the birch one of the most beautiful of the native trees it may be noticed that in dry and rocky situations it outstrips even the larch which many persons are tempted to plant merely on account of the speed of its growth <\s>
<s> the scotch fir is less attractive during its youth than any other plant but when full grown if it has had room to spread out its arms it becomes a noble tree and by those who are disinterested enough to plant for posterity it may be placed along with the sycamore near the house for from their massiveness both these trees unite well with buildings and in some situations with rocks also having in their forms and apparent substances the effect of something intermediate betwixt the immoveableness and solidity of stone and the spray and foliage of the lighter trees <\s>
<s> if these general rules be just what shall we say to whole acres of artificial shrubbery and exotic trees among rocks and dashing torrents with their own wild wood in sight where we have the whole contents of the nurseryman's catalogue jumbled together colour at war with colour and form with form among the most peaceful subjects of nature's kingdom everywhere discord distraction and bewilderment <\s>
<s> but this deformity bad as it is is not so obtrusive as the small patches and large tracts of larch plantations that are overrunning the hill sides <\s>
<s> to justify our condemnation of these let us again recur to nature <\s>
<s> the process by which she forms woods and forests is as follows <\s>
<s> seeds are scattered indiscriminately by winds brought by waters and dropped by birds <\s>
<s> they perish or produce according as the soil and situation upon which they fall are suited to them and under the same dependence the seedling or the sucker if not cropped by animals which nature is often careful to prevent by fencing it about with brambles or other prickly shrubs thrives and the tree grows sometimes single taking its own shape without constraint but for the most part compelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours <\s>
<s> from low and sheltered places vegetation travels upwards to the more exposed and the young plants are protected and to a certain degree fashioned by those that have preceded them <\s>
<s> the continuous mass of foliage which would be thus produced is broken by rocks or by glades or open places where the browzing of animals has prevented the growth of wood <\s>
<s> as vegetation ascends the winds begin also to bear their part in moulding the forms of the trees but thus mutually protected trees though not of the hardiest kind are enabled to climb high up the mountains <\s>
<s> gradually however by the quality of the ground and by increasing exposure a stop is put to their ascent the hardy trees only are left those also by little and little give way and a wild and irregular boundary is established graceful in its outline and never contemplated without some feeling more or less distinct of the powers of nature by which it is imposed <\s>
<s> contrast the liberty that encourages and the law that limits this joint work of nature and time with the disheartening necessities restrictions and disadvantages under which the artificial planter must proceed even he whom long observation and fine feeling have best qualified for his task <\s>
<s> in the first place his trees however well chosen and adapted to their several situations must generally start all at the same time and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connection of parts that sympathy and organisation if i may so express myself which pervades the whole of a natural wood and appears to the eye in its single trees its masses of foliage and their various colours when they are held up to view on the side of a mountain or when spread over a valley they are looked down upon from an eminence <\s>
<s> it is therefore impossible under any circumstances for the artificial planter to rival the beauty of nature <\s>
<s> but a moment's thought will show that if ten thousand of this spiky tree the larch are stuck in at once upon the side of a hill they can grow up into nothing but deformity that while they are suffered to stand we shall look in vain for any of those appearances which are the chief sources of beauty in a natural wood <\s>
<s> it must be acknowledged that the larch till it has outgrown the size of a shrub shows when looked at singly some elegance in form and appearance especially in spring decorated as it then is by the pink tassels of its blossoms but as a tree it is less than any other pleasing its branches for boughs it has none have no variety in the youth of the tree and little dignity even when it attains its full growth leaves it cannot be said to have consequently neither affords shade nor shelter <\s>
<s> in spring the larch becomes green long before the native trees and its green is so peculiar and vivid that finding nothing to harmonise with it wherever it comes forth a disagreeable speck is produced <\s>
<s> in summer when all other trees are in their pride it is of a dingy lifeless hue in autumn of a spiritless unvaried yellow and in winter it is still more lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous tree of the forest for they seem only to sleep but the larch appears absolutely dead <\s>
<s> if an attempt be made to mingle thickets or a certain proportion of other forest trees with the larch its horizontal branches intolerantly cut them down as with a scythe or force them to spindle up to keep pace with it <\s>
<s> the terminating spike renders it impossible that the several trees where planted in numbers should ever blend together so as to form a mass or masses of wood <\s>
<s> add thousands to tens of thousands and the appearance is still the same a collection of separate individual trees obstinately presenting themselves as such and which from whatever point they are looked at if but seen may be counted upon the fingers <\s>
<s> sunshine or shadow has little power to adorn the surface of such a wood and the trees not carrying up their heads the wind raises among them no majestic undulations <\s>
<s> it is indeed true that in countries where the larch is a native and where without interruption it may sweep from valley to valley and from hill to hill a sublime image may be produced by such a forest in the same manner as by one composed of any other single tree to the spreading of which no limits can be assigned <\s>
<s> for sublimity will never be wanting where the sense of innumerable multitude is lost in and alternates with that of intense unity and to the ready perception of this effect similarity and almost identity of individual form and monotony of colour contribute <\s>
<s> but this feeling is confined to the native immeasurable forest no artificial plantation can give it <\s>
<s> the foregoing observations will i hope as nothing has been condemned or recommended without a substantial reason have some influence upon those who plant for ornament merely <\s>
<s> to such as plant for profit i have already spoken <\s>
<s> let me then entreat that the native deciduous trees may be left in complete possession of the lower ground and that plantations of larch if introduced at all may be confined to the highest and most barren tracts <\s>
<s> interposition of rocks would there break the dreary uniformity of which we have been complaining and the winds would take hold of the trees and imprint upon their shapes a wildness congenial to their situation <\s>
<s> having determined what kinds of trees must be wholly rejected or at least very sparingly used by those who are unwilling to disfigure the country and having shown what kinds ought to be chosen i should have given if my limits had not already been overstepped a few practical rules for the manner in which trees ought to be disposed in planting <\s>
<s> but to this subject i should attach little importance if i could succeed in banishing such trees as introduce deformity and could prevail upon the proprietor to confine himself either to those found in the native woods or to such as accord with them <\s>
<s> this is indeed the main point for much as these scenes have been injured by what has been taken from them buildings trees and woods either through negligence necessity avarice or caprice it is not the removals but the harsh additions that have been made which are the worst grievance a standing and unavoidable annoyance <\s>
<s> often have i felt this distinction with mingled satisfaction and regret for if no positive deformity or discordance be substituted or superinduced such is the benignity of nature that take away from her beauty after beauty and ornament after ornament her appearance cannot be marred the scars if any be left will gradually disappear before a healing spirit and what remains will still be soothing and pleasing many hearts deplored the fate of those old trees and oft with pain the traveller at this day will stop and gaze on wrongs which nature scarcely seems to heed for sheltered places bosoms nooks and bays and the pure mountains and the gentle tweed and the green silent pastures yet remain <\s>
<s> there are few ancient woods left in this part of england upon which such indiscriminate ravage as is here deplored could now be committed <\s>
<s> but out of the numerous copses fine woods might in time be raised probably without sacrifice of profit by leaving at the periodical fellings a due proportion of the healthiest trees to grow up into timber this plan has fortunately in many instances been adopted and they who have set the example are entitled to the thanks of all persons of taste <\s>
<s> as to the management of planting with reasonable attention to ornament let the images of nature be your guide and the whole secret lurks in a few words thickets or underwoods single trees trees clustered or in groups groves unbroken woods but with varied masses of foliage glades invisible or winding boundaries in rocky districts a seemly proportion of rock left wholly bare and other parts half hidden disagreeable objects concealed and formal lines broken trees climbing up to the horizon and in some places ascending from its sharp edge in which they are rooted with the whole body of the tree appearing to stand in the clear sky in other parts woods surmounted by rocks utterly bare and naked which add to the sense of height as if vegetation could not thither be carried and impress a feeling of duration power of resistance and security from change <\s>
<s> the author has been induced to speak thus at length by a wish to preserve the native beauty of this delightful district because still further changes in its appearance must inevitably follow from the change of inhabitants and owners which is rapidly taking place about the same time that strangers began to be attracted to the country and to feel a desire to settle in it the difficulty that would have stood in the way of their procuring situations was lessened by an unfortunate alteration in the circumstances of the native peasantry proceeding from a cause which then began to operate and is now felt in every house <\s>
<s> the family of each man whether estatesman or farmer formerly had a twofold support first the produce of his lands and flocks and secondly the profit drawn from the employment of the women and children as manufacturers spinning their own wool in their own houses work chiefly done in the winter season and carrying it to market for sale <\s>
<s> hence however numerous the children the income of the family kept pace with its increase <\s>
<s> but by the invention and universal application of machinery this second resource has been cut off the gains being so far reduced as not to be sought after but by a few aged persons disabled from other employment <\s>
<s> doubtless the invention of machinery has not been to these people a pure loss for the profits arising from home manufactures operated as a strong temptation to choose that mode of labour in neglect of husbandry <\s>
<s> they also participate in the general benefit which the island has derived from the increased value of the produce of land brought about by the establishment of manufactories and in the consequent quickening of agricultural industry <\s>
<s> but this is far from making them amends and now that home manufactures are nearly done away though the women and children might at many seasons of the year employ themselves with advantage in the fields beyond what they are accustomed to do yet still all possible exertion in this way cannot be rationally expected from persons whose agricultural knowledge is so confined and above all where there must necessarily be so small a capital <\s>
<s> the consequence then is that proprietors and farmers being no longer able to maintain themselves upon small farms several are united in one and the buildings go to decay or are destroyed and that the lands of the estatesmen being mortgaged and the owners constrained to part with them they fall into the hands of wealthy purchasers who in like manner unite and consolidate and if they wish to become residents erect new mansions out of the ruins of the ancient cottages whose little enclosures with all the wild graces that grew out of them disappear <\s>
<s> the feudal tenure under which the estates are held has indeed done something towards checking this influx of new settlers but so strong is the inclination that these galling restraints are endured and it is probable that in a few years the country on the margin of the lakes will fall almost entirely into the possession of gentry either strangers or natives <\s>
<s> it is then much to be wished that a better taste should prevail among these new proprietors and as they cannot be expected to leave things to themselves that skill and knowledge should prevent unnecessary deviations from that path of simplicity and beauty along which without design and unconsciously their humble predecessors have moved <\s>
<s> in this wish the author will be joined by persons of pure taste throughout the whole island who by their visits often repeated to the lakes in the north of england testify that they deem the district a sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy <\s>
<s> west in his well known guide to the lakes recommends as the best season for visiting this country the interval from the beginning of june to the end of august and the two latter months being a time of vacation and leisure it is almost exclusively in these that strangers resort hither <\s>
<s> but that season is by no means the best the colouring of the mountains and woods unless where they are diversified by rocks is of too unvaried a green and as a large portion of the vallies is allotted to hay grass some want of variety is found there also <\s>
<s> the meadows however are sufficiently enlivened after hay making begins which is much later than in the southern part of the island <\s>
<s> a stronger objection is rainy weather setting in sometimes at this period with a vigour and continuing with a perseverance that may remind the disappointed and dejected traveller of those deluges of rain which fall among the abyssinian mountains for the annual supply of the nile <\s>
<s> the months of september and october particularly october are generally attended with much finer weather and the scenery is then beyond comparison more diversified more splendid and beautiful but on the other hand short days prevent long excursions and sharp and chill gales are unfavourable to parties of pleasure out of doors <\s>
<s> nevertheless to the sincere admirer of nature who is in good health and spirits and at liberty to make a choice the six weeks following the 1st of september may be recommended in preference to july and august <\s>
<s> for there is no inconvenience arising from the season which to such a person would not be amply compensated by the autumnal appearance of any of the more retired vallies into which discordant plantations and unsuitable buildings have not yet found entrance in such spots at this season there is an admirable compass and proportion of natural harmony in colour through the whole scale of objects in the tender green of the after grass upon the meadows interspersed with islands of grey or mossy rock crowned by shrubs and trees in the irregular inclosures of standing corn or stubble fields in like manner broken in the mountain sides glowing with fern of divers colours in the calm blue lakes and river pools and in the foliage of the trees through all the tints of autumn from the pale and brilliant yellow of the birch and ash to the deep greens of the unfaded oak and alder and of the ivy upon the rocks upon the trees and the cottages <\s>
<s> yet as most travellers are either stinted or stint themselves for time the space between the middle or last week in may and the middle or last week of june may be pointed out as affording the best combination of long days fine weather and variety of impressions <\s>
<s> few of the native trees are then in full leaf but for whatever maybe wanting in depth of shade more than an equivalent will be found in the diversity of foliage in the blossoms of the fruit and berry bearing trees which abound in the woods and in the golden flowers of the broom and other shrubs with which many of the copses are interveined <\s>
<s> in those woods also and on those mountain sides which have a northern aspect and in the deep dells many of the spring flowers still linger while the open and sunny places are stocked with the flowers of the approaching summer <\s>
<s> and besides is not an exquisite pleasure still untasted by him who has not heard the choir of linnets and thrushes chaunting their love songs in the copses woods and hedge rows of a mountainous country safe from the birds of prey which build in the inaccessible crags and are at all hours seen or heard wheeling about in the air <\s>
<s> the number of these formidable creatures is probably the cause why in the narrow vallies there are no skylarks as the destroyer would be enabled to dart upon them from the near and surrounding crags before they could descend to their ground nests for protection <\s>
<s> it is not often that the nightingale resorts to these vales but almost all the other tribes of our english warblers are numerous and their notes when listened to by the side of broad still waters or when heard in unison with the murmuring of mountain brooks have the compass of their power enlarged accordingly <\s>
<s> there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley very different from any thing which can be excited by the same sound in a flat country <\s>
<s> nor must a circumstance be omitted which here renders the close of spring especially interesting i mean the practice of bringing down the ewes from the mountains to yean in the vallies and enclosed grounds <\s>
<s> the herbage being thus cropped as it springs that first tender emerald green of the season which would otherwise have lasted little more than a fortnight is prolonged in the pastures and meadows for many weeks while they are farther enlivened by the multitude of lambs bleating and skipping about <\s>
<s> these sportive creatures as they gather strength are turned out upon the open mountains and with their slender limbs their snow white colour and their wild and light motions beautifully accord or contrast with the rocks and lawns upon which they must now begin to seek their food <\s>
<s> and last but not least at this time the traveller will be sure of room and comfortable accommodation even in the smaller inns <\s>
<s> i am aware that few of those who may be inclined to profit by this recommendation will be able to do so as the time and manner of an excursion of this kind are mostly regulated by circumstances which prevent an entire freedom of choice <\s>
<s> it will therefore be more pleasant to observe that though the months of july and august are liable to many objections yet it often happens that the weather at this time is not more wet and stormy than they who are really capable of enjoying the sublime forms of nature in their utmost sublimity would desire <\s>
