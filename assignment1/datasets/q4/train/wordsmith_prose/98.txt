<s> 20 1751 to march 1826 was author of the luise a rural epopaea of simple structure divided into three idyls which relate the betrothment and marriage of the heroine <\s>
<s> this is a pleasing and very peculiar poem composed in hexameter verse <\s>
<s> the charm of the narrative says mr <\s>
<s> t consists in the minute description of the local domestic manners of the personages <\s>

<s> voss's translation of the odyssey is praised for being so perfect an imitation of the original <\s>
<s> the greek has been rendered with a fidelity and imitative harmony so admirable that it suggests to the scholar the original wording and reflects as from a mirror every beauty and every blemish of the ancient poem <\s>
<s> the night scene which is the 5th of act iv is fine too in a frantic way <\s>
<s> for the german possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds both with prepositions and with epithets as the greek it can express the richest single greek word in a single german one and is thus freed from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases <\s>

<s> the use of the prefixed participles ver zer ent and weg thus reissen to rend verreissen to rend away zerreissen to rend to pieces entreissen to rend off or out of a thing in the active sense or schmelzen to melt ver zer ent schmelzen and in like manner through all the verbs neuter and active <\s>
<s> if you consider only how much we should feel the loss of the prefix be as in bedropt besprinkle besot especially in our poetical language and then think that this same mode of composition is carried through all their simple and compound prepositions and many of their adverbs and that with most of these the germans have the same privilege as we have of dividing them from the verb and placing them at the end of the sentence you will have no difficulty in comprehending the reality and the cause of this superior power in the german of condensing meaning in which its great poet exulted <\s>
<s> it is impossible to read half a dozen pages of wieland without perceiving that in this respect the german has no rival but the greek <\s>
<s> and yet i feel that concentration or condensation is not the happiest mode of expressing this excellence which seems to consist not so much in the less time required for conveying an impression as in the unity and simultaneousness with which the impression is conveyed <\s>
<s> it tends to make their language more picturesque it depictures images better <\s>
<s> we have obtained this power in part by our compound verbs derived from the latin and the sense of its great effect no doubt induced our milton both to the use and the abuse of latin derivatives <\s>

<s> at the beginning of the french revolution klopstock wrote odes of congratulation <\s>

<s> but when french liberty metamorphosed herself into a fury he sent back these presents with a palinodia declaring his abhorrence of their proceedings and since then he has been perhaps more than enough an anti gallican <\s>

<s> for the german possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds both with prepositions and with epithets as the greek it can express the richest single greek word in a single german one and is thus freed from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases <\s>

<s> if you consider only how much we should feel the loss of the prefix be as in bedropt besprinkle besot especially in our poetical language and then think that this same mode of composition is carried through all their simple and compound prepositions and many of their adverbs and that with most of these the germans have the same privilege as we have of dividing them from the verb and placing them at the end of the sentence you will have no difficulty in comprehending the reality and the cause of this superior power in the german of condensing meaning in which its great poet exulted <\s>
<s> it is impossible to read half a dozen pages of wieland without perceiving that in this respect the german has no rival but the greek <\s>
<s> and yet i feel that concentration or condensation is not the happiest mode of expressing this excellence which seems to consist not so much in the less time required for conveying an impression as in the unity and simultaneousness with which the impression is conveyed <\s>

<s> i will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes which my friend w made of his conversations with klopstock during the interviews that took place after my departure <\s>

<s> i will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes which my friend w made of his conversations with klopstock during the interviews that took place after my departure <\s>
<s> on these i shall make but one remark at present and that will appear a presumptuous one namely that klopstock's remarks on the venerable sage of königsburg are to my own knowledge injurious and mistaken and so far is it from being true that his system is now given up that throughout the universities of germany there is not a single professor who is not either a kantean or a disciple of fichte whose system is built on the kantean and presupposes its truth or lastly who though an antagonist of kant as to his theoretical work has not embraced wholly or in part his moral system and adopted part of his nomenclature <\s>

<s> these were only of very moderate merit one day he was struck with the idea of what could be done in this way he kept his room a whole day even went without his dinner and found that in the evening he had written twenty three hexameters versifying a part of what he had before written in prose <\s>
<s> from that time pleased with his efforts he composed no more in prose <\s>
<s> to day he informed me that he had finished his plan before he read milton <\s>
<s> he was enchanted to see an author who before him had trod the same path <\s>

<s> i will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes which my friend w made of his conversations with klopstock during the interviews that took place after my departure <\s>
<s> on these i shall make but one remark at present and that will appear a presumptuous one namely that klopstock's remarks on the venerable sage of königsburg are to my own knowledge injurious and mistaken and so far is it from being true that his system is now given up that throughout the universities of germany there is not a single professor who is not either a kantean or a disciple of fichte whose system is built on the kantean and presupposes its truth or lastly who though an antagonist of kant as to his theoretical work has not embraced wholly or in part his moral system and adopted part of his nomenclature <\s>
<s> klopstock having wished to see the calvary of cumberland and asked what was thought of it in england i went to remnant's the english bookseller where i procured the analytical review in which is contained the review of cumberland's calvary <\s>

<s> this though done with much labour and some success was far from satisfying him <\s>
<s> he had composed hexameters both latin and greek as a school exercise and there had been also in the german language attempts in that style of versification <\s>
<s> these were only of very moderate merit one day he was struck with the idea of what could be done in this way he kept his room a whole day even went without his dinner and found that in the evening he had written twenty three hexameters versifying a part of what he had before written in prose <\s>
<s> from that time pleased with his efforts he composed no more in prose <\s>
<s> to day he informed me that he had finished his plan before he read milton <\s>
<s> he was enchanted to see an author who before him had trod the same path <\s>
<s> this is a contradiction of what he said before <\s>
<s> he did not wish to speak of his poem to any one till it was finished but some of his friends who had seen what he had finished tormented him till he had consented to publish a few books in a journal <\s>
<s> he was then i believe very young about twenty five <\s>

<s> klopstock having wished to see the calvary of cumberland and asked what was thought of it in england i went to remnant's the english bookseller where i procured the analytical review in which is contained the review of cumberland's calvary <\s>

<s> these were only of very moderate merit one day he was struck with the idea of what could be done in this way he kept his room a whole day even went without his dinner and found that in the evening he had written twenty three hexameters versifying a part of what he had before written in prose <\s>
<s> from that time pleased with his efforts he composed no more in prose <\s>

<s> his ode to m <\s>
<s> le comte du luc is as fine an example as i know of the modern classical style <\s>
<s> this is quite different from that which is exemplified in wordsworth's laodamia and serjeant talfourd's ion for in them the subjects only are ancient while both the form and spirit are modern whereas in the odes of rousseau a modern subject is treated as far as difference of times and language will allow in the manner and tone of the ancients <\s>

<s> he wrote for the stage at the beginning of his literary life but with no great success <\s>
<s> s c he recommended me to read his hermann before i read either the messiah or the odes <\s>
<s> he flattered himself that some time or other his dramatic poems would be known in england <\s>

<s> 20 1751 to march 1826 was author of the luise a rural epopaea of simple structure divided into three idyls which relate the betrothment and marriage of the heroine <\s>
<s> this is a pleasing and very peculiar poem composed in hexameter verse <\s>
<s> the charm of the narrative says mr <\s>
<s> t consists in the minute description of the local domestic manners of the personages <\s>
<s> the charm consists i think in the blending of these manners with the beauty of nature and the ease and suitability of the versification <\s>
<s> voss's translation of the odyssey is praised for being so perfect an imitation of the original <\s>
<s> the greek has been rendered with a fidelity and imitative harmony so admirable that it suggests to the scholar the original wording and reflects as from a mirror every beauty and every blemish of the ancient poem <\s>
<s> the night scene which is the 5th of act iv is fine too in a frantic way <\s>
<s> for the german possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds both with prepositions and with epithets as the greek it can express the richest single greek word in a single german one and is thus freed from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases <\s>
<s> i will content myself with one example at present viz <\s>
<s> the use of the prefixed participles ver zer ent and weg thus reissen to rend verreissen to rend away zerreissen to rend to pieces entreissen to rend off or out of a thing in the active sense or schmelzen to melt ver zer ent schmelzen and in like manner through all the verbs neuter and active <\s>
<s> if you consider only how much we should feel the loss of the prefix be as in bedropt besprinkle besot especially in our poetical language and then think that this same mode of composition is carried through all their simple and compound prepositions and many of their adverbs and that with most of these the germans have the same privilege as we have of dividing them from the verb and placing them at the end of the sentence you will have no difficulty in comprehending the reality and the cause of this superior power in the german of condensing meaning in which its great poet exulted <\s>
<s> it is impossible to read half a dozen pages of wieland without perceiving that in this respect the german has no rival but the greek <\s>
<s> and yet i feel that concentration or condensation is not the happiest mode of expressing this excellence which seems to consist not so much in the less time required for conveying an impression as in the unity and simultaneousness with which the impression is conveyed <\s>
<s> it tends to make their language more picturesque it depictures images better <\s>
<s> we have obtained this power in part by our compound verbs derived from the latin and the sense of its great effect no doubt induced our milton both to the use and the abuse of latin derivatives <\s>
<s> but still these prefixed particles conveying no separate or separable meaning to the mere english reader cannot possibly act on the mind with the force or liveliness of an original and homogeneous language such as the german is and besides are confined to certain words <\s>
<s> we now took our leave <\s>
<s> at the beginning of the french revolution klopstock wrote odes of congratulation <\s>
<s> he received some honorary presents from the french republic a golden crown i believe and like our priestley was invited to a seat in the legislature which he declined <\s>
<s> but when french liberty metamorphosed herself into a fury he sent back these presents with a palinodia declaring his abhorrence of their proceedings and since then he has been perhaps more than enough an anti gallican <\s>
<s> i mean that in his just contempt and detestation of the crimes and follies of the revolutionists he suffers himself to forget that the revolution itself is a process of the divine providence and that as the folly of men is the wisdom of god so are their iniquities instruments of his goodness <\s>
<s> from klopstock's house we walked to the ramparts discoursing together on the poet and his conversation till our attention was diverted to the beauty and singularity of the sunset and its effects on the objects around us <\s>
<s> there were woods in the distance <\s>

<s> over that part of the woods which lay immediately under the intenser light a brassy mist floated <\s>

<s> all else was obscure <\s>
<s> it was a fairy scene and to increase its romantic character among the moving objects thus divided into alternate shade and brightness was a beautiful child dressed with the elegant simplicity of an english child riding on a stately goat the saddle bridle and other accoutrements of which were in a high degree costly and splendid <\s>

<s> i will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes which my friend w made of his conversations with klopstock during the interviews that took place after my departure <\s>
<s> on these i shall make but one remark at present and that will appear a presumptuous one namely that klopstock's remarks on the venerable sage of königsburg are to my own knowledge injurious and mistaken and so far is it from being true that his system is now given up that throughout the universities of germany there is not a single professor who is not either a kantean or a disciple of fichte whose system is built on the kantean and presupposes its truth or lastly who though an antagonist of kant as to his theoretical work has not embraced wholly or in part his moral system and adopted part of his nomenclature <\s>
<s> klopstock having wished to see the calvary of cumberland and asked what was thought of it in england i went to remnant's the english bookseller where i procured the analytical review in which is contained the review of cumberland's calvary <\s>

<s> the first three cantos he wrote in a species of measured or numerous prose <\s>
<s> this though done with much labour and some success was far from satisfying him <\s>
<s> he had composed hexameters both latin and greek as a school exercise and there had been also in the german language attempts in that style of versification <\s>
<s> these were only of very moderate merit one day he was struck with the idea of what could be done in this way he kept his room a whole day even went without his dinner and found that in the evening he had written twenty three hexameters versifying a part of what he had before written in prose <\s>
<s> from that time pleased with his efforts he composed no more in prose <\s>
<s> to day he informed me that he had finished his plan before he read milton <\s>
<s> he was enchanted to see an author who before him had trod the same path <\s>

<s> he did not wish to speak of his poem to any one till it was finished but some of his friends who had seen what he had finished tormented him till he had consented to publish a few books in a journal <\s>
<s> he was then i believe very young about twenty five <\s>
<s> the rest was printed at different periods four books at a time <\s>
<s> the reception given to the first specimens was highly flattering <\s>
