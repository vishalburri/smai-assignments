<s> buttermere may be visited by a shorter way through newlands but though the descent upon the vale of buttermere by this approach is very striking as it also is to one entering by the head of the vale under honister crag yet after all the best entrance from keswick is from the lower part of the vale having gone over whinlater to scale hill where there is a roomy inn with very good accommodation <\s>
<s> the mountains of the vale of buttermere and crummock are no where so impressive as from the bosom of crummock water <\s>
<s> scale force near it is a fine chasm with a lofty though but slender fall of water <\s>
<s> from scale hill a pleasant walk may be taken to an eminence in mr <\s>
<s> marshall's woods and another by crossing the bridge at the foot of the hill upon which the inn stands and turning to the right after the opposite hill has been ascended a little way then follow the road for half a mile or so that leads towards lorton looking back upon crummock water c between the openings of the fences <\s>
<s> turn back and make your way to lowes water <\s>
<s> but this small lake is only approached to advantage from the other end therefore any traveller going by this road to wastdale must look back upon it <\s>
<s> this road to wastdale after passing the village of lamplugh cross presents suddenly a fine view of the lake of ennerdale with its mountains and six or seven miles beyond leads down upon calder abbey <\s>
<s> little of this ruin is left but that little is well worthy of notice <\s>
<s> at calder bridge are two comfortable inns and a few miles beyond accommodations may be had at the strands at the foot of wastdale <\s>
<s> into wastdale are three horse roads viz <\s>
<s> over the stye from borrowdale a short cut from eskdale by burnmore tarn which road descends upon the head of the lake and the principal entrance from the open country by the strands at its foot <\s>
<s> this last is much the best approach <\s>
<s> wastdale is well worth the notice of the traveller who is not afraid of fatigue no part of the country is more distinguished by sublimity <\s>
<s> wast water may also be visited from ambleside by going up langdale over hardknot and wrynose down eskdale and by irton hall to the strands but this road can only be taken on foot or on horseback or in a cart <\s>
<s> we will conclude with ullswater as being perhaps upon the whole the happiest combination of beauty and grandeur which any of the lakes affords <\s>
<s> it lies not more than ten miles from ambleside and the pass of kirkstone and the descent from it are very impressive but notwithstanding this vale like the others loses much of its effect by being entered from the head so that it is better to go from keswick through matterdale and descend upon gowbarrow park you are thus brought at once upon a magnificent view of the two higher reaches of the lake <\s>
<s> ara force thunders down the ghyll on the left at a small distance from the road <\s>
<s> if ullswater be approached from penrith a mile and a half brings you to the winding vale of eamont and the prospects increase in interest till you reach patterdale but the first four miles along ullswater by this road are comparatively tame and in order to see the lower part of the lake to advantage it is necessary to go round by pooley bridge and to ride at least three miles along the westmoreland side of the water towards martindale <\s>
<s> the views especially if you ascend from the road into the fields are magnificent yet this is only mentioned that the transient visitant may know what exists for it would be inconvenient to go in search of them <\s>
<s> they who take this course of three or four miles on foot should have a boat in readiness at the end of the walk to carry them across to the cumberland side of the lake near old church thence to pursue the road upwards to patterdale <\s>
<s> the church yard yew tree still survives at old church but there are no remains of a place of worship a new chapel having been erected in a more central situation which chapel was consecrated by the then bishop of carlisle when on his way to crown queen elizabeth he being the only prelate who would undertake the office <\s>
<s> it may be here mentioned that bassenthwaite chapel yet stands in a bay as sequestered as the site of old church such situations having been chosen in disturbed times to elude marauders <\s>
<s> the trunk or body of the vale of ullswater need not be further noticed as its beauties show themselves but the curious traveller may wish to know something of its tributary streams <\s>
<s> at dalemain about three miles from penrith a stream is crossed called the dacre or dacor which name it bore as early as the time of the venerable bede <\s>
<s> this stream does not enter the lake but joins the eamont a mile below <\s>
<s> it rises in the moorish country about penruddock flows down a soft sequestered valley passing by the ancient mansions of hutton john and dacre castle <\s>
<s> the former is pleasantly situated though of a character somewhat gloomy and monastic and from some of the fields near dalemain dacre castle backed by the jagged summit of saddle back with the valley and stream in front forms a grand picture <\s>
<s> there is no other stream that conducts to any glen or valley worthy of being mentioned till we reach that which leads up to ara force and thence into matterdale before spoken of <\s>
<s> matterdale though a wild and interesting spot has no peculiar features that would make it worth the stranger's while to go in search of them but in gowbarrow park the lover of nature might linger for hours <\s>
<s> here is a powerful brook which dashes among rocks through a deep glen hung on every side with a rich and happy intermixture of native wood here are beds of luxuriant fern aged hawthorns and hollies decked with honeysuckles and fallow deer glancing and bounding over the lawns and through the thickets <\s>
<s> these are the attractions of the retired views or constitute a foreground for ever varying pictures of the majestic lake forced to take a winding course by bold promontories and environed by mountains of sublime form towering above each other <\s>
<s> at the outlet of gowbarrow park we reach a third stream which flows through a little recess called glencoin where lurks a single house yet visible from the road <\s>
<s> let the artist or leisurely traveller turn aside to it for the buildings and objects around them are romantic and picturesque <\s>
<s> having passed under the steeps of styebarrow crag and the remains of its native woods at glenridding bridge a fourth stream is crossed <\s>
<s> the opening on the side of ullswater vale down which this stream flows is adorned with fertile fields cottages and natural groves that agreeably unite with the transverse views of the lake and the stream if followed up after the enclosures are left behind will lead along bold water breaks and waterfalls to a silent tarn in the recesses of helvellyn <\s>
<s> this desolate spot was formerly haunted by eagles that built in the precipice which forms its western barrier <\s>
<s> these birds used to wheel and hover round the head of the solitary angler <\s>
<s> it also derives a melancholy interest from the fate of a young man a stranger who perished some years ago by falling down the rocks in his attempt to cross over to grasmere <\s>
<s> his remains were discovered by means of a faithful dog that had lingered here for the space of three months self supported and probably retaining to the last an attachment to the skeleton of its master <\s>
<s> but to return to the road in the main vale of ullswater at the head of the lake being now in patterdale we cross a fifth stream grisdale beck this would conduct through a woody steep where may be seen some unusually large ancient hollies up to the level area of the valley of grisdale hence there is a path for foot travellers and along which a horse may be led to grasmere <\s>
<s> a sublime combination of mountain forms appears in front while ascending the bed of this valley and the impression increases till the path leads almost immediately under the projecting masses of helvellyn <\s>
<s> having retraced the banks of the stream to patterdale and pursued the road up the main dale the next considerable stream would if ascended in the same manner conduct to deep dale the character of which valley may be conjectured from its name <\s>
<s> it is terminated by a cove a craggy and gloomy abyss with precipitous sides a faithful receptacle of the snows that are driven into it by the west wind from the summit of fairfield <\s>
<s> lastly having gone along the western side of brotherswater and passed hartsop hall a stream soon after issues from a cove richly decorated with native wood <\s>
<s> this spot is i believe never explored by travellers but from these sylvan and rocky recesses whoever looks back on the gleaming surface of brotherswater or forward to the precipitous sides and lofty ridges of dove crag c will be equally pleased with the beauty the grandeur and the wildness of the scenery <\s>
<s> seven glens or vallies have been noticed which branch off from the cumberland side of the vale <\s>
<s> the opposite side has only two streams of any importance one of which would lead up from the point where it crosses the kirkstone road near the foot of brotherswater to the decaying hamlet of hartsop remarkable for its cottage architecture and thence to hayswater much frequented by anglers <\s>
<s> the other coming down martindale enters ullswater at sandwyke opposite to gowbarrow park <\s>
<s> no persons but such as come to patterdale merely to pass through it should fail to walk as far as blowick the only enclosed land which on this side borders the higher part of the lake <\s>
<s> the axe has here indiscriminately levelled a rich wood of birches and oaks that divided this favoured spot into a hundred pictures <\s>
<s> it has yet its land locked bays and rocky promontories but those beautiful woods are gone which perfected its seclusion and scenes that might formerly have been compared to an inexhaustible volume are now spread before the eye in a single sheet magnificent indeed but seemingly perused in a moment <\s>
<s> from blowick a narrow track conducts along the craggy side of place fell richly adorned with juniper and sprinkled over with birches to the village of sandwyke a few straggling houses that with the small estates attached to them occupy an opening opposite to lyulph's tower and gowbarrow park <\s>
<s> in martindale 49 the road loses sight of the lake and leads over a steep hill bringing you again into view of ullswater <\s>
<s> its lowest reach four miles in length is before you and the view terminated by the long ridge of cross fell in the distance <\s>
<s> immediately under the eye is a deep indented bay with a plot of fertile land traversed by a small brook and rendered cheerful by two or three substantial houses of a more ornamented and showy appearance than is usual in those wild spots <\s>
<s> from pooley bridge at the foot of the lake haweswater may be conveniently visited <\s>
<s> haweswater is a lesser ullswater with this advantage that it remains undefiled by the intrusion of bad taste <\s>
<s> lowther castle is about four miles from pooley bridge and if during this tour the stranger has complained as he will have had reason to do of a want of majestic trees he may be abundantly recompensed for his loss in the far spreading woods which surround that mansion <\s>
<s> visitants for the most part see little of the beauty of these magnificent grounds being content with the view from the terrace but the whole course of the lowther from askham to the bridge under brougham hall presents almost at every step some new feature of river woodland and rocky landscape <\s>
<s> a portion of this tract has from its beauty acquired the name of the elysian fields but the course of the stream can only be followed by the pedestrian <\s>
<s> 227 about 200 yards beyond the last house on the keswick side of rydal village the road is cut through a low wooded rock called thrang crag <\s>
