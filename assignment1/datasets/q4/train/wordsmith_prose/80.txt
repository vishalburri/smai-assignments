<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>

<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>

<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>

<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>

<s> but i am too particular for the limits of my paper <\s>
<s> we followed the lake of como to its head and thence proceeded to chiavenna where we began to pass a range of the alps which brought us into the country of the grisons at sovozza <\s>

<s> suffice it to say that after passing a day in visiting the romantic valley of glaris we proceeded by the lake of wallenstadt and the canton of appenzell to the lake of constance where this letter was begun nine days ago <\s>

<s> to day is the 14th of september and i hope we shall be in england by the 10th of october <\s>
<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>
<s> but it is time to talk about england <\s>
<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>
<s> kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence <\s>
<s> i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out <\s>
<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>
<s> we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits <\s>
<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>
<s> our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite <\s>
<s> but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter <\s>

<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>

<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>

<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>

<s> suffice it to say that after passing a day in visiting the romantic valley of glaris we proceeded by the lake of wallenstadt and the canton of appenzell to the lake of constance where this letter was begun nine days ago <\s>

<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>

<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>

<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>
<s> but it is time to talk about england <\s>
<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>
<s> kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence <\s>
<s> i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out <\s>
<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>
<s> we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits <\s>
<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>
<s> our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite <\s>
<s> but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter <\s>

<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>
<s> i shall be better able to judge whether i am likely to enjoy this pleasure in about three weeks <\s>
<s> i shall probably write to you again before i quit france if not most certainly immediately on my landing in england <\s>

<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>

<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>

<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>
<s> but it is time to talk about england <\s>
<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>
<s> kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence <\s>
<s> i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out <\s>
<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>
<s> we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits <\s>
<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>
<s> our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite <\s>
<s> but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter <\s>
<s> it has been written as you will see by its different shades at many sittings and is in fact the produce of most of the leisure which i have had since it was begun and is now finally drawing to a conclusion it being on the 16th of september <\s>
<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>
<s> i shall be better able to judge whether i am likely to enjoy this pleasure in about three weeks <\s>
<s> i shall probably write to you again before i quit france if not most certainly immediately on my landing in england <\s>

<s> we followed the lake of como to its head and thence proceeded to chiavenna where we began to pass a range of the alps which brought us into the country of the grisons at sovozza <\s>

<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>

<s> but i am too particular for the limits of my paper <\s>
<s> we followed the lake of como to its head and thence proceeded to chiavenna where we began to pass a range of the alps which brought us into the country of the grisons at sovozza <\s>

<s> to day is the 14th of september and i hope we shall be in england by the 10th of october <\s>
<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>
<s> but it is time to talk about england <\s>
<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>
<s> kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence <\s>
<s> i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out <\s>
<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>
<s> we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits <\s>
<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>
<s> our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite <\s>
<s> but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter <\s>
<s> it has been written as you will see by its different shades at many sittings and is in fact the produce of most of the leisure which i have had since it was begun and is now finally drawing to a conclusion it being on the 16th of september <\s>
<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>
<s> i shall be better able to judge whether i am likely to enjoy this pleasure in about three weeks <\s>
<s> i shall probably write to you again before i quit france if not most certainly immediately on my landing in england <\s>
<s> you will remember me affectionately to my uncle and aunt as he was acquainted with my giving up all thoughts of a fellowship he may perhaps not be so much displeased at this journey <\s>

<s> i have had during the course of this delightful tour a great deal of uneasiness from an apprehension of your anxiety on my account <\s>
<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>

<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>

<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>

<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>

<s> we followed the lake of como to its head and thence proceeded to chiavenna where we began to pass a range of the alps which brought us into the country of the grisons at sovozza <\s>

<s> i have thought of you perpetually and never have my eyes burst upon a scene of particular loveliness but i have almost instantly wished that you could for a moment be transported to the place where i stood to enjoy it <\s>
<s> i have been more particularly induced to form those wishes because the scenes of switzerland have no resemblance to any i have found in england consequently it may probably never be in your power to form an idea of them <\s>
<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>

<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>

<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>

<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>

<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>

<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>

<s> we are now as i observed above upon the point of quitting these most sublime and beautiful parts and you cannot imagine the melancholy regret which i feel at the idea <\s>
<s> i am a perfect enthusiast in my admiration of nature in all her various forms and i have looked upon and as it were conversed with the objects which this country has presented to my view so long and with such increasing pleasure that the idea of parting from them oppresses me with a sadness similar to what i have always felt in quitting a beloved friend <\s>
<s> there is no reason to be surprised at the strong attachment which the swiss have always shown to their native country <\s>
<s> much of it must undoubtedly have been owing to those charms which have already produced so powerful an effect upon me and to which the rudest minds cannot possibly be indifferent <\s>
<s> ten thousand times in the course of this tour have i regretted the inability of my memory to retain a more strong impression of the beautiful forms before me and again and again in quitting a fortunate station have i returned to it with the most eager avidity in the hope of bearing away a more lively picture <\s>
<s> at this moment when many of these landscapes are floating before my mind i feel a high enjoyment in reflecting that perhaps scarcely a day of my life will pass in which i shall not derive some happiness from these images <\s>
<s> with regard to the manners of the inhabitants of this singular country the impressions which we have had often occasion to receive have been unfavourable but it must be remembered that we have had little to do but with innkeepers and those corrupted by perpetual intercourse with strangers <\s>
<s> had we been able to speak the language which is german and had we time to insinuate ourselves into their cottages we should probably have had as much occasion to admire the simplicity of their lives as the beauties of their country <\s>
<s> my partiality to switzerland excited by its natural charms induces me to hope that the manners of the inhabitants are amiable but at the same time i cannot help frequently comparing them with those of the french and as far as i have had opportunity to observe they lose very much by the comparison <\s>
<s> we not only found the french a much less imposing people but that politeness diffused through the lowest ranks had an air so engaging that you could scarce attribute it to any other cause than real benevolence <\s>
<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>

<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>

<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>

<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>

<s> during the time which was near a month that we were in france we had not once to complain of the smallest deficiency in courtesy in any person much less of any positive rudeness <\s>
<s> we had also perpetual occasion to observe that cheerfulness and sprightliness for which the french have always been remarkable <\s>
<s> but i must remind you that we crossed at the time when the whole nation was mad with joy in consequence of the revolution <\s>
<s> it was a most interesting period to be in france and we had many delightful scenes where the interest of the picture was owing solely to this cause <\s>
<s> i was also much pleased with what i saw of the italians during the short time we were among them <\s>
<s> we had several times occasion to observe a softness and elegance which contrasted strongly with the severe austereness of their neighbours on the other side of the alps <\s>
<s> it was with pleasure i observed at a small inn on the lake of como the master of it playing upon his harpsichord with a large collection of italian music about him <\s>
<s> the outside of the instrument was such that it would not much have graced an english drawing room but the tones that he drew from it were by no means contemptible <\s>
<s> but it is time to talk about england <\s>
<s> when you write to my brothers i must beg of you to give my love and tell them i am sorry it has not been in my power to write to them <\s>
<s> kit will be surprised he has not heard from me as we were almost upon terms of regular correspondence <\s>
<s> i had not heard from richard for some time before i set out <\s>
<s> i did not call upon him when i was in london not so much because we were determined to hurry through london but because he as many of our friends at cambridge did would look upon our scheme as mad and impracticable <\s>
<s> i expect great pleasure on my return to cambridge in exulting over those of my friends who threatened us with such an accumulation of difficulties as must undoubtedly render it impossible for us to perform the tour <\s>
<s> every thing however has succeeded with us far beyond my most sanguine expectations <\s>
<s> we have it is true met with little disasters occasionally but far from distressing and they rather gave us additional resolution and spirits <\s>
<s> we have both enjoyed most excellent health and we have been so inured to walking that we are become almost insensible to fatigue <\s>
<s> we have several times performed a journey of thirteen leagues over the most mountainous parts of switzerland without any more weariness than if we had been walking an hour in the groves of cambridge <\s>
<s> our appearance is singular and we have often observed that in passing through a village we have excited a general smile <\s>
<s> our coats which we had made light on purpose for the journey are of the same piece and our manner of carrying our bundles which is upon our heads with each an oak stick in our hands contributes not a little to that general curiosity which we seem to excite <\s>
<s> but i find i have again relapsed into egotism and must here entreat you not only to pardon this fault but also to make allowance for the illegible hand and desultory style of this letter <\s>
<s> it has been written as you will see by its different shades at many sittings and is in fact the produce of most of the leisure which i have had since it was begun and is now finally drawing to a conclusion it being on the 16th of september <\s>
<s> i flatter myself still with the hope of seeing you for a fortnight or three weeks if it be agreeable to my uncle as there will be no necessity for me to be in cambridge before the 10th of november <\s>
<s> i shall be better able to judge whether i am likely to enjoy this pleasure in about three weeks <\s>
<s> i shall probably write to you again before i quit france if not most certainly immediately on my landing in england <\s>
<s> you will remember me affectionately to my uncle and aunt as he was acquainted with my giving up all thoughts of a fellowship he may perhaps not be so much displeased at this journey <\s>
<s> i should be sorry if i have offended him by it <\s>
<s> i hope my little cousin is well <\s>
<s> i must now bid you adieu with assuring you that you are perpetually in my thoughts and that i remain most affectionately yours w <\s>
<s> on looking over this letter i am afraid you will not be able to read half of it <\s>

<s> you will see by the date of this letter that i am in wales and whether you remember the place of jones's residence or no you will immediately conclude that i am with him <\s>
<s> i quitted london about three weeks ago where my time passed in a strange manner sometimes whirled about by the vortex of its strenua inertia and sometimes thrown by the eddy into a corner of the stream <\s>
<s> think not however that i had not many pleasant hours .... <\s>
<s> my time has been spent since i reached wales in a very agreeable manner and jones and i intend to make a tour through its northern counties on foot as you will easily suppose 26 6 <\s>
<s> melancholy of a friend <\s>
<s> i regret much not to have been made acquainted with your wish to have employed your vacation in a pedestrian tour both on your account as it would have contributed greatly to exhilarate your spirits and on mine as we should have gained much from the addition of your society <\s>
<s> such an excursion would have served like an aurora borealis to gild your long lapland night of melancholy 27 7 <\s>

<s> the french revolution 1792 <\s>
<s> the horrors excited by the relation of the events consequent upon the commencement of hostilities is general <\s>
<s> not but that there are some men who felt a gloomy satisfaction from a measure which seemed to put the patriot army out of a possibility of success <\s>
<s> an ignominious flight the massacre of their general a dance performed with savage joy round his burning body the murder of six prisoners are events which would have arrested the attention of the reader of the annals of morocco <\s>
<s> he then expresses his fear that the patriot army would be routed by the invaders <\s>
<s> but suppose he adds that the german army is at the gates of paris what will be the consequence <\s>
<s> it will be impossible for it to make any material alterations in the constitution impossible to reinstate the clergy in its ancient guilty splendour impossible to restore an existence to the noblesse similar to that it before enjoyed impossible to add much to the authority of the king <\s>

<s> at paris his feelings were still more disturbed by the abortive issue of louvet's denunciation of robespierre he began to forebode the commencement of the reign of terror he was paralysed with sorrow and dismay and stung with disappointment that no paramount spirit had emerged to abash the impious crests of the leaders of the atheist crew and to quell outrage and bloody power and to clear a passage for just government and leave a solid birthright to the state 30 29 extract of letter to mathews may 17 1792 memoirs i <\s>

<s> hereditary distinctions and privileged orders of every species i think must necessarily counteract the progress of human improvement <\s>

<s> i conceive that a more excellent system of civil policy might be established among us yet in my ardour to attain the goal i do not forget the nature of the ground where the race is to be run <\s>
<s> the destruction of those institutions which i condemn appears to me to be hastening on too rapidly <\s>
<s> i recoil from the very idea of a revolution <\s>
<s> i am a determined enemy to every species of violence <\s>
<s> i see no connection but what the obstinacy of pride and ignorance renders necessary between justice and the sword between reason and bonds <\s>
<s> i deplore the miserable condition of the french and think that we can only be guarded from the same scourge by the undaunted efforts of good men .... <\s>
<s> i severely condemn all inflammatory addresses to the passions of men <\s>
<s> i know that the multitude walk in darkness <\s>
