<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> dear sir george lady beaumont in a letter to my sister told her some time ago that it was your intention to have written to me but knowing my aversion to letter writing you were unwilling to impose upon me the trouble of answering <\s>
<s> i am much obliged to you for the honour you intended me and deeply sensible of your delicacy <\s>
<s> if a man were what he ought to be with such feelings and such motives as i have it would be as easy for him to write to sir george beaumont as to take his food when he was hungry or his repose when he was weary <\s>
<s> but we suffer bad habits to grow upon us and that has been the case with me as you have had reason to find and forgive already <\s>
<s> i cannot quit the subject without regretting that any weakness of mine should have prevented my hearing from you which would always give me great delight and though i cannot presume to say that i should be a punctual correspondent i am sure i should not be insensible of your kindness but should also do my best to deserve it <\s>
<s> a few days ago i received from mr <\s>
<s> southey your very acceptable present of sir joshua reynolds's works which with the life i have nearly read through <\s>
<s> several of the discourses i had read before though never regularly together they have very much added to the high opinion which i before entertained of sir joshua reynolds <\s>
<s> of a great part of them never having had an opportunity of studying any pictures whatsoever i can be but a very inadequate judge but of such parts of the discourses as relate to general philosophy i may be entitled to speak with more confidence and it gives me great pleasure to say to you knowing your great regard for sir joshua that they appear to me highly honourable to him <\s>
<s> the sound judgment universally displayed in these discourses is truly admirable i mean the deep conviction of the necessity of unwearied labour and diligence the reverence for the great men of his art and the comprehensive and unexclusive character of his taste <\s>
<s> is it not a pity sir george that a man with such a high sense of the dignity of his art and with such industry should not have given more of his time to the nobler departments of painting <\s>
<s> i do not say this so much on account of what the world would have gained by the superior excellence and interest of his pictures though doubtless that would have been very considerable but for the sake of example <\s>
<s> it is such an animating sight to see a man of genius regardless of temporary gains whether of money or praise fixing his attention solely upon what is intrinsically interesting and permanent and finding his happiness in an entire devotion of himself to such pursuits as shall most ennoble human nature <\s>
<s> we have not yet seen enough of this in modern times and never was there a period in society when such examples were likely to do more good than at present <\s>
<s> the industry and love of truth which distinguish sir joshua's mind are most admirable but he appears to me to have lived too much for the age in which he lived and the people among whom he lived though this in an infinitely less degree than his friend burke of whom goldsmith said with such truth long ago that born for the universe he narrowed his mind and to party gave up what was meant for mankind <\s>
<s> i should not have said thus much of reynolds which i have not said without pain but because i have so great a respect for his character and because he lived at a time when being the first englishman distinguished for excellence in the higher department of painting he had the field fairly open for him to have given an example upon which all eyes needs must have been fixed of a man preferring the cultivation and exertion of his own powers in the highest possible degree to any other object of regard <\s>
<s> my writing is growing quite illegible <\s>
<s> i must therefore either mend it or throw down the pen <\s>
<s> how sorry we all are under this roof that we cannot have the pleasure of seeing you and lady beaumont down this summer <\s>
<s> the weather has been most glorious and the country of course most delightful <\s>
<s> our own valley in particular was last night by the light of the full moon and in the perfect stillness of the lake a scene of loveliness and repose as affecting as was ever beheld by the eye of man <\s>
<s> we have had a day and a half of mr <\s>
<s> davy's company at grasmere and no more he seemed to leave us with great regret being post haste on his way to edinburgh <\s>
<s> i went with him to paterdale on his road to penrith where he would take coach <\s>
<s> we had a deal of talk about you and lady beaumont he was in your debt a letter as i found and exceedingly sorry that he had not been able to get over to see you having been engaged at mr <\s>
<s> coke's sheep shearing which had not left him time to cross from the duke of bedford's to your place <\s>
<s> we had a very pleasant interview though far too short <\s>
<s> he is a most interesting man whose views are fixed upon worthy objects <\s>
<s> that loughrigg tarn beautiful pool of water as it is is a perpetual mortification to me when i think that you and lady beaumont were so near having a summer nest there <\s>
<s> this is often talked over among us and we always end the subject with a heigh ho <\s>
<s> but i must think of concluding <\s>
<s> my sister thanks lady beaumont for her last letter and will write to her in a few days but i must say to her myself how happy i was to hear that her sister had derived any consolation from coleridge's poems and mine <\s>
<s> i must also add how much pleasure it gives me that lady beaumont is so kindly so affectionately disposed to my dear and good sister and also to the other unknown parts of my family <\s>
<s> could we but have coleridge back among us again <\s>
<s> there is no happiness in this life but in intellect and virtue <\s>
<s> those were very pretty verses which lady beaumont sent and we were much obliged to her for them <\s>
<s> what shocking bad writing i have sent you i don't know how it is but it seems as if i could not write any better <\s>

<s> the name of dorothy obsolete as it is now grown had been so long devoted in my own thoughts to the first daughter that i might have that i could not break this promise to myself a promise in which my wife participated though the name of mary to my ear the most musical and truly english in sound we have would have otherwise been most welcome to me including as it would lady beaumont and its mother <\s>

<s> when i ventured to express my regret at sir joshua reynolds giving so much of his time to portrait painting and to his friends i did not mean to recommend absolute solitude and seclusion from the world as an advantage to him or anybody else <\s>
<s> i think it a great evil and indeed in the case of a painter frequent intercourse with the living world seems absolutely necessary to keep the mind in health and vigour <\s>
<s> i spoke in some respects in compliment to sir joshua reynolds feeling deeply as i do the power of his genius and loving passionately the labours of genius in every way in which i am capable of comprehending them <\s>
