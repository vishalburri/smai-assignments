<s> i dislike display in everything above all in education .... <\s>
<s> the old dame did not affect to make theologians or logicians but she taught to read and she practised the memory often no doubt by rote but still the faculty was improved something perhaps she explained and trusted the rest to parents to masters and to the pastor of the parish <\s>
<s> i am sure as good daughters as good servants as good mothers and wives were brought up at that time as now when the world is so much less humble minded <\s>

<s> of the same to the same my dear sir i have taken a folio sheet to make certain minutes upon the subject of education <\s>
<s> as a christian preacher your business is with man as an immortal being <\s>
<s> let us imagine you to be addressing those and those only who would gladly co operate with you in any course of education which is most likely to ensure to men a happy immortality <\s>
<s> are you satisfied with that course which the most active of this class are bent upon <\s>
<s> clearly not as i remember from your conversation which is confirmed by your last letter <\s>
<s> great principles you hold are sacrificed to shifts and expedients <\s>
<s> i agree with you <\s>
<s> what more sacred law of nature for instance than that the mother should educate her child <\s>
<s> yet we felicitate ourselves upon the establishment of infant schools which is in direct opposition to it <\s>
<s> nay we interfere with the maternal instinct before the child is born by furnishing in cases where there is no necessity the mother with baby linen for her unborn child <\s>
<s> now that in too many instances a lamentable necessity may exist for this i allow but why should such charity be obtruded <\s>
<s> why should so many excellent ladies form themselves into committees and rush into an almost indiscriminate benevolence which precludes the poor mother from the strongest motive human nature can be actuated by for industry for forethought and self denial <\s>
<s> when the stream has thus been poisoned at its fountain head we proceed by separating through infant schools the mother from the child and from the rest of the family disburthening them of all care of the little one for perhaps eight hours of the day <\s>
<s> to those who think this an evil but a necessary one much might be said in order to qualify unreasonable expectations <\s>
<s> but there are thousands of stirring people now in england who are so far misled as to deem these schools good in themselves and to wish that even in the smallest villages the children of the poor should have what they call a good education in this way <\s>
<s> now these people and no error is at present more common confound education with tuition <\s>
<s> education i need not remark to you is everything that draws out the human being of which tuition the teaching of schools especially however important is comparatively an insignificant part <\s>
<s> yet the present bent of the public mind is to sacrifice the greater power to the less all that life and nature teach to the little that can be learned from books and a master <\s>
<s> in the eyes of an enlightened statesman this is absurd in the eyes of a pure lowly minded christian it is monstrous <\s>
<s> the spartan and other ancient communities might disregard domestic ties because they had the substitution of country which we cannot have <\s>
<s> with us country is a mere name compared with what it was to the greeks first as contrasted with barbarians and next and above all as that passion only was strong enough to preserve the individual his family and the whole state from ever impending destruction <\s>
<s> our course is to supplant domestic attachments without the possibility of substituting others more capacious <\s>
<s> what can grow out of it but selfishness <\s>
<s> let it then be universally admitted that infant schools are an evil only tolerated to qualify a greater viz the inability of mothers to attend to their children and the like inability of the elder to take care of the younger from their labour being wanted in factories or elsewhere for their common support <\s>
<s> but surely this is a sad state of society and if these expedients of tuition or education if that word is not to be parted with divert our attention from the fact that the remedy for so mighty an evil must be sought elsewhere they are most pernicious things and the sooner they are done away with the better <\s>
<s> but even as a course of tuition i have strong objections to infant schools and in no small degree to the madras system also <\s>
<s> we must not be deceived by premature adroitness <\s>
<s> the intellect must not be trained with a view to what the infant or child may perform without constant reference to what that performance promises for the man <\s>
<s> it is with the mind as with the body <\s>
<s> i recollect seeing a german babe stuffed with beer and beef who had the appearance of an infant hercules <\s>
<s> he might have enough in him of the old teutonic blood to grow up to a strong man but tens of thousands would dwindle and perish after such unreasonable cramming <\s>
<s> now i cannot but think that the like would happen with our modern pupils if the views of the patrons of these schools were realised <\s>
<s> the diet they offer is not the natural diet for infant and juvenile minds <\s>
<s> the faculties are over strained and not exercised with that simultaneous operation which ought to be aimed at as far as is practicable <\s>
<s> natural history is taught in infant schools by pictures stuck up against walls and such mummery <\s>
<s> a moment's notice of a red breast pecking by a winter's hearth is worth it all <\s>
<s> these hints are for the negative side of the question and for the positive what conceit and presumption and vanity and envy and mortification and hypocrisy c <\s>
<s> c are the unavoidable result of schemes where there is so much display and contention <\s>
<s> all this is at enmity with christianity and if the practice of sincere churchmen in this matter be so what have we not to fear when we cast our eyes upon other quarters where religious instruction is deliberately excluded <\s>
<s> the wisest of us expect far too much from school teaching <\s>
<s> one of the most innocent contented happy and in his sphere most useful men whom i know can neither read nor write <\s>
<s> though learning and sharpness of wit must exist somewhere to protect and in some points to interpret the scriptures yet we are told that the founder of this religion rejoiced in spirit that things were hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes and again out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise <\s>
<s> apparently the infants here contemplated were under a very different course of discipline from that which many in our day are condemned to <\s>
<s> in a town of lancashire about nine in the morning the streets resound with the crying of infants wheeled off in carts and other vehicles some ladies i believe lending their carriages for this purpose to their school prisons <\s>
<s> but to go back a little <\s>
<s> human learning as far as it tends to breed pride and self estimation and that it requires constant vigilance to counteract this tendency we must all feel is against the spirit of the gospel <\s>
<s> much cause then is there to lament that inconsiderate zeal wherever it is found which whets the intellect by blunting the affections <\s>
<s> can it in a general view be good that an infant should learn much which its parents do not know <\s>
<s> will not the child arrogate a superiority unfavourable to love and obedience <\s>
<s> but suppose this to be an evil only for the present generation and that a succeeding race of infants will have no such advantage over their parents still it may be asked should we not be making these infants too much the creatures of society when we cannot make them more so <\s>
<s> here would they be for eight hours in the day like plants in a conservatory <\s>
<s> what is to become of them for the other sixteen hours when they are returned to all the influences the dread of which first suggested this contrivance <\s>
<s> will they be better able to resist the mischief they may be exposed to from the bad example of their parents or brothers and sisters <\s>
<s> it is to be feared not because though they must have heard many good precepts their condition in school is artificial they have been removed from the discipline and exercise of humanity and they have besides been subject to many evil temptations within school and peculiar to it <\s>
<s> in the present generation i cannot see anything of an harmonious co operation between these schools and home influences <\s>
<s> if the family be thoroughly bad and the child cannot be removed altogether how feeble the barrier how futile the expedient <\s>
<s> if the family be of middle character the children will lose more by separation from domestic cares and reciprocal duties than they can possibly gain from captivity with such formal instruction as may be administered <\s>
