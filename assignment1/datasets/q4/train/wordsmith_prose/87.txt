<s> in putting together that edition i was obliged to cut up several copies and as several of the poems also changed their places some confusion and omission and in one instance a repetition was the consequence <\s>
<s> nothing however so bad as in the edition of 1820 where a long poem the lament of mary queen of scots was by mistake altogether omitted <\s>
<s> another unpleasantness arose from the same cause for in some instances notwithstanding repeated charges to the printer you have only two spenserian stanzas in a page i speak now of the last edition instead of three and there is the same irregularity in printing other forms of stanza <\s>
