<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>

<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>

<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>

<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>

<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>

<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>

<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>

<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>

<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>

<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>

<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>

<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>

<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>

<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>

<s> letter to sir george h <\s>
<s> 1811 cottage 7 minutes walk from the sea side near bootle cumberland <\s>
<s> my dear sir george how shall i appear before you again after so long an interval <\s>
<s> it seems that now i ought rather to begin with an apology for writing than for not having written during a space of almost twelve months <\s>
<s> i have blamed myself not a little yet not so much as i should have done had i not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection i feel for you on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom i loved less <\s>
<s> accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen and in the mean while from my more intimate concerns i have abstained partly because i do not in many cases myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper and still more because it is my wish at all times when i think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure <\s>
<s> having made this avowal i trust that what may be wanting to my justification will be made up by your kindness and forgiving disposition <\s>
<s> it was near about this time last year that we were employed in our pleasant tour to the leasowes and hagley <\s>
<s> the twelve months that have elapsed have not impaired the impressions which those scenes made upon me nor weakened my remembrance of the delight which the places and objects and the conversations they led to awakened in our minds <\s>
<s> it is very late to mention that when in wales last autumn i contrived to pass a day and a half with your friend price at foxley <\s>
<s> he was very kind and took due pains to show me all the beauties of his place <\s>
<s> i should have been very insensible not to be pleased with and grateful for his attentions and certainly i was gratified by the sight of the scenes through which he conducted me <\s>
<s> i was less able to do justice in my own mind to the scenery of foxley <\s>
<s> you will perhaps think it a strange fault that i am going to find with it considering the acknowledged taste of the owner viz <\s>
<s> that small as it is compared with hundreds of places the domain is too extensive for the character of the country <\s>
<s> wanting both rock and water it necessarily wants variety and in a district of this kind the portion of a gentleman's estate which he keeps exclusively to himself and which he devotes wholly or in part to ornament may very easily exceed the proper bounds not indeed as to the preservation of wood but most easily as to every thing else <\s>
<s> a man by little and little becomes so delicate and fastidious with respect to forms in scenery where he has a power to exercise a control over them that if they do not exactly please him in all moods and every point of view his power becomes his law he banishes one and then rids himself of another impoverishing and monotonising landscapes which if not originally distinguished by the bounty of nature must be ill able to spare the inspiriting varieties which art and the occupations and wants of life in a country left more to itself never fail to produce <\s>
<s> this relish of humanity foxley wants and is therefore to me in spite of all its recommendations a melancholy spot i mean that part of it which the owner keeps to himself and has taken so much pains with <\s>
<s> i heard the other day of two artists who thus expressed themselves upon the subject of a scene among our lakes plague upon those vile enclosures <\s>
<s> said one they spoil everything <\s>
<s> oh said the other i never see them <\s>
<s> glover was the name of this last <\s>
<s> now for my part i should not wish to be either of these gentlemen but to have in my own mind the power of turning to advantage wherever it is possible every object of art and nature as they appear before me <\s>
<s> what a noble instance as you have often pointed out to me has rubens given of this in that picture in your possession where he has brought as it were a whole county into one landscape and made the most formal partitions of cultivation hedge rows of pollard willows conduct the eye into the depths and distances of his picture and thus more than by any other means has given it that appearance of immensity which is so striking <\s>
<s> as i have slipped into the subject of painting i feel anxious to inquire whether your pencil has been busy last winter in the solitude and uninterrupted quiet of dunmow <\s>
<s> most likely you know that we have changed our residence in grasmere which i hope will be attended with a great overbalance of advantages <\s>
<s> one we are certain of that we have at least one sitting room clear of smoke i trust in all winds .... <\s>
<s> over the chimney piece is hung your little picture from the neighbourhood of coleorton <\s>
<s> in our other house on account of the frequent fits of smoke from the chimneys both the pictures which i have from your hand were confined to bed rooms <\s>
<s> a few days after i had enjoyed the pleasure of seeing in different moods of mind your coleorton landscape from my fire side it suggested to me the following sonnet which having walked out to the side of grasmere brook where it murmurs through the meadows near the church i composed immediately praised be the art whose subtle power could stay yon cloud and fix it in that glorious shape nor would permit the thin smoke to escape <\s>
<s> nor those bright sunbeams to forsake the day which stopped that band of travellers on their way ere they were lost within the shady wood and showed the bark upon the glassy flood for ever anchored in her sheltering bay <\s>
<s> the images of the smoke and the travellers are taken from your picture the rest were added in order to place the thought in a clear point of view and for the sake of variety <\s>
<s> i hope coleorton continues to improve upon you and lady beaumont and that mr <\s>
<s> taylor's new laws and regulations are at least peaceably submitted to <\s>
<s> and i return in a few days to grasmere <\s>
<s> we cannot say that the child for whose sake we came down to the sea side has derived much benefit from the bathing <\s>
<s> the weather has been very unfavourable we have however contrived to see every thing that lies within a reasonable walk of our present residence among other places mulcaster at least as much of it as can be seen from the public road but the noble proprietor has contrived to shut himself up so with plantations and chained gates and locks that whatever prospects he may command from his stately prison or rather fortification can only be guessed at by the passing traveller <\s>
<s> in the state of blindness and unprofitable peeping in which we were compelled to pursue our way up a long and steep hill i could not help observing to my companion that the hibernian peer had completely given the lie to the poet thomson when in a strain of proud enthusiasm he boasts i care not fortune what you me deny you cannot rob me of free nature's grace you cannot shut the windows of the sky through which aurora shows her brightening face you cannot bar my constant feet to trace the woods and lawns by living stream c <\s>
<s> castle of indolence the windows of the sky were not shut indeed but the business was done more thoroughly for the sky was nearly shut out altogether <\s>
<s> this is like most others a bleak and treeless coast but abounding in corn fields and with a noble beach which is delightful either for walking or riding <\s>
<s> the isle of man is right opposite our window and though in this unsettled weather often invisible its appearance has afforded us great amusement <\s>
<s> one afternoon above the whole length of it was stretched a body of clouds shaped and coloured like a magnificent grove in winter when whitened with snow and illuminated by the morning sun which having melted the snow in part has intermingled black masses among the brightness <\s>
<s> the whole sky was scattered over with fleecy dark clouds such as any sunshiny day produces and which were changing their shapes and position every moment <\s>
<s> but this line of clouds immoveably attached themselves to the island and manifestly took their shape from the influence of its mountains <\s>
<s> there appeared to be just span enough of sky to allow the hand to slide between the top of sn√¢fell the highest peak in the island and the base of this glorious forest in which little change was noticeable for more than the space of half an hour <\s>
<s> we had another fine sight one evening walking along a rising ground about two miles distant from the shore <\s>
<s> it was about the hour of sunset and the sea was perfectly calm and in a quarter where its surface was indistinguishable from the western sky hazy and luminous with the setting sun appeared a tall sloop rigged vessel magnified by the atmosphere through which it was viewed and seeming rather to hang in the air than to float upon the waters <\s>
<s> milton compares the appearance of satan to a fleet descried far off at sea <\s>
<s> the visionary grandeur and beautiful form of this single vessel could words have conveyed to the mind the picture which nature presented to the eye would have suited his purpose as well as the largest company of vessels that ever associated together with the help of a trade wind in the wide ocean yet not exactly so and for this reason that his image is a permanent one not dependent upon accident <\s>
<s> i have not left myself room to assure you how sincerely i remain your affectionate friend w <\s>

<s> to sir george beaumont bart <\s>
<s> my dear sir george long since ought i to have thanked you for your last affectionate letter but i knew how indulgent you were and therefore fell i won't say more easily but surely with far less pain to myself into my old trick of procrastination <\s>
<s> i was deeply sensible of your kindness in inviting me to grosvenor square and then felt and still feel a strong inclination to avail myself of the opportunity of cultivating your friendship and that of lady beaumont and of seeing a little of the world at the same time <\s>
<s> but as the wish is strong there are also strong obstacles against it first though i have lately been tolerably industrious i am far behind hand with my appointed work and next my nervous system is so apt to be deranged by going from home that i am by no means sure that i should not be so much of a dependent invalid i mean a person obliged to manage himself as to make it absolutely improper for me to obtrude myself where neither my exertions of mind or body could enable me to be tolerable company <\s>
<s> i say nothing of my family because a short absence would be abundantly recompensed by the pleasure of a sweet return <\s>
<s> at all events i must express my sincere thanks for your kindness and the pleasure which i received from your letter breathing throughout such favourable dispositions i may say such earnest friendship towards me <\s>
<s> i think we are completely agreed upon the subject of sir joshua that is we both regret that he did not devote more of his time to the higher branches of the art and further i think you join with me in lamenting to a certain degree at least that he did not live more to himself <\s>
<s> i have since read the rest of his discourses with which i have been greatly pleased and wish most heartily that i could have an opportunity of seeing in your company your own collection of pictures and some others in town mr <\s>
<s> angerstein's for instance to have pointed out to me some of those finer and peculiar beauties of painting which i am afraid i shall never have an occasion of becoming sufficiently familiar with pictures to discover of myself <\s>
<s> there is not a day in my life when i am at home in which that exquisite little drawing of yours of applethwaite does not affect me with a sense of harmony and grace which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> edridge an artist whom you know saw this drawing along with a mr <\s>
<s> duppa another artist who published hints from raphael and michael angelo and they were both most enthusiastic in their praise of it to my great delight <\s>
<s> by the bye i thought mr <\s>
<s> edridge a man of very mild and pleasing manners and as far as i could judge of delicate feelings in the province of his art <\s>
<s> duppa is publishing a life of michael angelo and i received from him a few days ago two proof sheets of an appendix which contains the poems of m a which i shall read and translate one or two of them if i can do it with decent success <\s>
<s> i have peeped into the sonnets and they do not appear at all unworthy of their great author <\s>
<s> you will be pleased to hear that i have been advancing with my work i have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks <\s>
<s> i do not know if you are exactly acquainted with the plan of my poetical labour it is twofold first a poem to be called the recluse in which it will be my object to express in verse my most interesting feelings concerning man nature and society and next a poem in which i am at present chiefly engaged on my earlier life or the growth of my own mind taken up upon a large scale <\s>
<s> this latter work i expect to have finished before the month of may and then i purpose to fall with all my might on the former which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been fixed these many years <\s>
<s> of this poem that of the pedlar 25 which coleridge read you is part and i may have written of it altogether about 2000 lines <\s>
<s> it will consist i hope of about ten or twelve thousand <\s>
<s> the pedlar was the title once proposed from the character of the wanderer but abandoned <\s>
<s> p 304 may we not hope for the pleasure of seeing you and lady beaumont down here next summer <\s>
<s> i flatter myself that coleridge will then be return'd and though we would not on any account that he should fix himself in this rainy part of england yet perhaps we may have the happiness of meeting all together for a few weeks <\s>
<s> we have lately built in our little rocky orchard a little circular hut lined with moss like a wren's nest and coated on the outside with heath that stands most charmingly with several views from the different sides of it of the lake the valley and the church sadly spoiled however lately by being white washed <\s>
<s> the little retreat is most delightful and i am sure you and lady beaumont would be highly pleased with it <\s>
<s> coleridge has never seen it <\s>
<s> what a happiness would it be to us to see him there and entertain you all next summer in our homely way under its shady thatch <\s>
<s> i will copy a dwarf inscription which i wrote for it the other day before the building was entirely finished which indeed it is not yet <\s>
<s> no whimsy of the purse is here no pleasure house forlorn use comfort do this roof endear a tributary shed to chear the little cottage that is near to help it and adorn <\s>
<s> i hope the young roscius if he go on as he has begun will rescue the english theatre from the infamy that has fallen upon it and restore the reign of good sense and nature <\s>
<s> from what you have seen sir george do you think he could manage a character of shakspeare <\s>
<s> neither selin nor douglas require much power but even to perform them as he does talents and genius i should think must be necessary <\s>
<s> i had very little hope i confess thinking it very natural that a theatre which had brought a dog upon the stage as a principal performer would catch at a wonder whatever shape it might put on <\s>
<s> we have had no tidings of coleridge these several months <\s>
<s> he spoke of papers which he had sent by private hands none of which we have received <\s>
<s> it must be most criminal neglect somewhere if the fever be suffered to enter malta <\s>
<s> farewell and believe me my dear sir george your affectionate and sincere friend w <\s>
