<s> my dear sir george i have wished to write to you every day this long time but i have also had another wish which has interfered to prevent me i mean the wish to resume my poetical labours time was stealing away fast from me and nothing done and my mind still seeming unfit to do anything <\s>
<s> at first i had a strong impulse to write a poem that should record my brother's virtues and be worthy of his memory <\s>
<s> i began to give vent to my feelings with this view but i was overpowered by my subject and could not proceed <\s>
<s> i composed much but it is all lost except a few lines as it came from me in such a torrent that i was unable to remember it <\s>
<s> i could not hold the pen myself and the subject was such that i could not employ mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth or my sister as my amanuensis <\s>
<s> this work must therefore rest awhile till i am something calmer i shall however never be at peace till as far as in me lies i have done justice to my departed brother's memory <\s>
<s> his heroic death the particulars of which i have now accurately collected from several of the survivors exacts this from me and still more his singularly interesting character and virtuous and innocent life <\s>
<s> unable to proceed with this work i turned my thoughts again to the poem on my own life and you will be glad to hear that i have added 300 lines to it in the course of last week <\s>
<s> two books more will conclude it <\s>
<s> it will be not much less than 9000 lines not hundred but thousand lines long an alarming length <\s>
<s> and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself <\s>
<s> it is not self conceit as you will know well that has induced me to do this but real humility <\s>
<s> i began the work because i was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident of my own powers <\s>
<s> here at least i hoped that to a certain degree i should be sure of succeeding as i had nothing to do but describe what i had felt and thought therefore could not easily be bewildered <\s>
<s> this might certainly have been done in narrower compass by a man of more address but i have done my best <\s>
<s> if when the work shall be finished it appears to the judicious to have redundancies they shall be lopped off if possible but this is very difficult to do when a man has written with thought and this defect whenever i have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine i have always found incurable <\s>
<s> the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception <\s>
<s> if you see coleridge before i do do not speak of this to him as i should like to have his judgment unpreoccupied by such an apprehension <\s>
<s> i wish much to have your further opinion of the young roscius above all of his hamlet <\s>
<s> it is certainly impossible that he should understand the character that is the composition of the character <\s>
<s> but many of the sentiments which are put into hamlet's mouth he may be supposed to be capable of feeling and to a certain degree of entering into the spirit of some of the situations <\s>
<s> i never saw hamlet acted myself nor do i know what kind of a play they make of it <\s>
<s> i think i have heard that some parts which i consider among the finest are omitted in particular hamlet's wild language after the ghost has disappeared <\s>
<s> the players have taken intolerable liberties with shakspeare's plays especially with richard the third which though a character admirably conceived and drawn is in some scenes bad enough in shakspeare himself but the play as it is now acted has always appeared to me a disgrace to the english stage <\s>
<s> hamlet i suppose is treated by them with more reverence <\s>
<s> they are both characters far far above the abilities of any actor whom i have ever seen <\s>
<s> henderson was before my time and of course garrick <\s>
<s> we are looking anxiously for coleridge perhaps he may be with you now <\s>
<s> we were afraid that he might have had to hear other bad news of our family as lady beaumont's little god daughter has lately had that dangerous complaint the croup particularly dangerous here where we are thirteen miles from any medical advice on which we can have the least reliance <\s>

<s> shakspeare we are told had scarcely written a single play at that age <\s>
<s> i hope for the sake of poets you are proud of these men <\s>

<s> received a day or two ago a letter from a friend who had letters from malta not from coleridge but a miss stoddart who is there with her brother <\s>
<s> these letters are of the date of the fifth of march and speak of him as looking well and quite well and talking of coming home but doubtful whether by land or sea <\s>
<s> i have the pleasure to say that i finished my poem about a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> i had looked forward to the day as a most happy one and i was indeed grateful to god for giving me life to complete the work such as it is <\s>
<s> but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about it the reality so far short of the expectation <\s>
<s> it was the first long labour that i had finished and the doubt whether i should ever live to write the recluse and the sense which i had of this poem being so far below what i seemed capable of executing depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me the joy which i should have had in showing him the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams <\s>
<s> i have spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the occasion being new <\s>
<s> this work may be considered as a sort of portico to the recluse part of the same building which i hope to be able ere long to begin with in earnest and if i am permitted to bring it to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic kind i shall consider the task of my life as over <\s>
<s> i ought to add that i have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as i apprehended <\s>
<s> i wish much to hear from you if you have leisure but as you are so indulgent to me it would be the highest injustice were i otherwise to you <\s>
<s> we have read madoc and been highly pleased with it <\s>
<s> it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much except perhaps young llewellyn whose situation is highly interesting and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece <\s>
<s> his speech to his uncle at their meeting in the island is particularly interesting <\s>
<s> the poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind imagination in the true sense of the word and knowledge of human nature and the human heart <\s>
<s> there is nothing that shows the hand of the great master but the beauties in description are innumerable for instance that of the figure of the bard towards the beginning of the convention of the bards receiving the poetic inspiration that of the wife of tlalala the savage going out to meet her husband that of madoc and the atzecan king with a long name preparing for battle everywhere indeed you have beautiful descriptions and it is a work which does the author high credit i think <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i have wished to write to you every day this long time but i have also had another wish which has interfered to prevent me i mean the wish to resume my poetical labours time was stealing away fast from me and nothing done and my mind still seeming unfit to do anything <\s>
<s> at first i had a strong impulse to write a poem that should record my brother's virtues and be worthy of his memory <\s>

<s> unable to proceed with this work i turned my thoughts again to the poem on my own life and you will be glad to hear that i have added 300 lines to it in the course of last week <\s>

<s> but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about it the reality so far short of the expectation <\s>

<s> and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself <\s>
<s> it is not self conceit as you will know well that has induced me to do this but real humility <\s>
<s> i began the work because i was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident of my own powers <\s>

<s> the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception <\s>
<s> if you see coleridge before i do do not speak of this to him as i should like to have his judgment unpreoccupied by such an apprehension <\s>

<s> but many of the sentiments which are put into hamlet's mouth he may be supposed to be capable of feeling and to a certain degree of entering into the spirit of some of the situations <\s>
<s> i never saw hamlet acted myself nor do i know what kind of a play they make of it <\s>
<s> i think i have heard that some parts which i consider among the finest are omitted in particular hamlet's wild language after the ghost has disappeared <\s>
<s> the players have taken intolerable liberties with shakspeare's plays especially with richard the third which though a character admirably conceived and drawn is in some scenes bad enough in shakspeare himself but the play as it is now acted has always appeared to me a disgrace to the english stage <\s>

<s> at first i had a strong impulse to write a poem that should record my brother's virtues and be worthy of his memory <\s>
<s> i began to give vent to my feelings with this view but i was overpowered by my subject and could not proceed <\s>
<s> i composed much but it is all lost except a few lines as it came from me in such a torrent that i was unable to remember it <\s>
<s> i could not hold the pen myself and the subject was such that i could not employ mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth or my sister as my amanuensis <\s>
<s> this work must therefore rest awhile till i am something calmer i shall however never be at peace till as far as in me lies i have done justice to my departed brother's memory <\s>
<s> his heroic death the particulars of which i have now accurately collected from several of the survivors exacts this from me and still more his singularly interesting character and virtuous and innocent life <\s>
<s> unable to proceed with this work i turned my thoughts again to the poem on my own life and you will be glad to hear that i have added 300 lines to it in the course of last week <\s>
<s> two books more will conclude it <\s>
<s> it will be not much less than 9000 lines not hundred but thousand lines long an alarming length <\s>
<s> and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself <\s>
<s> it is not self conceit as you will know well that has induced me to do this but real humility <\s>
<s> i began the work because i was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident of my own powers <\s>
<s> here at least i hoped that to a certain degree i should be sure of succeeding as i had nothing to do but describe what i had felt and thought therefore could not easily be bewildered <\s>
<s> this might certainly have been done in narrower compass by a man of more address but i have done my best <\s>
<s> if when the work shall be finished it appears to the judicious to have redundancies they shall be lopped off if possible but this is very difficult to do when a man has written with thought and this defect whenever i have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine i have always found incurable <\s>
<s> the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception <\s>
<s> if you see coleridge before i do do not speak of this to him as i should like to have his judgment unpreoccupied by such an apprehension <\s>
<s> i wish much to have your further opinion of the young roscius above all of his hamlet <\s>
<s> it is certainly impossible that he should understand the character that is the composition of the character <\s>
<s> but many of the sentiments which are put into hamlet's mouth he may be supposed to be capable of feeling and to a certain degree of entering into the spirit of some of the situations <\s>
<s> i never saw hamlet acted myself nor do i know what kind of a play they make of it <\s>
<s> i think i have heard that some parts which i consider among the finest are omitted in particular hamlet's wild language after the ghost has disappeared <\s>
<s> the players have taken intolerable liberties with shakspeare's plays especially with richard the third which though a character admirably conceived and drawn is in some scenes bad enough in shakspeare himself but the play as it is now acted has always appeared to me a disgrace to the english stage <\s>
<s> hamlet i suppose is treated by them with more reverence <\s>
<s> they are both characters far far above the abilities of any actor whom i have ever seen <\s>
<s> henderson was before my time and of course garrick <\s>
<s> we are looking anxiously for coleridge perhaps he may be with you now <\s>
<s> we were afraid that he might have had to hear other bad news of our family as lady beaumont's little god daughter has lately had that dangerous complaint the croup particularly dangerous here where we are thirteen miles from any medical advice on which we can have the least reliance <\s>
<s> her case has been a mild one but sufficient to alarm us much and mrs <\s>
<s> wordsworth and her aunt have undergone much fatigue in sitting up as for nearly a fortnight she had very bad nights <\s>
<s> she yet requires much care and attention <\s>
<s> is your building going on <\s>
<s> i was mortified that the sweet little valley of which you spoke some time ago was no longer in the possession of your family it is the place i believe where that illustrious and most extraordinary man beaumont the poet and his brother were born <\s>
<s> one is astonished when one thinks of that man having been only eight and twenty years of age for i believe he was no more when he died <\s>
<s> shakspeare we are told had scarcely written a single play at that age <\s>
<s> i hope for the sake of poets you are proud of these men <\s>
<s> lady beaumont mentioned some time ago that you were painting a picture from the thorn is it finished <\s>
<s> i should like to see it the poem is a favourite with me and i shall love it the better for the honour you have done it <\s>
<s> we shall be most happy to have the other drawing which you promised us some time ago <\s>
<s> the dimensions of the applethwaite one are eight inches high and a very little above ten broad this of course exclusive of the margin <\s>
<s> i am anxious to know how your health goes on we are better than we had reason to expect <\s>
<s> when we look back upon this spring it seems like a dreary dream to us <\s>
<s> but i trust in god that we shall yet bear up and steer right onward <\s>
<s> i am your affectionate friend w <\s>
<s> my sister thanks lady beaumont for her letter the short one of the other day and hopes to be able to write soon <\s>

<s> my dear sir george i write to you from the moss hut at the top of my orchard the sun just sinking behind the hills in front of the entrance and his light falling upon the green moss of the side opposite me <\s>
<s> a linnet is singing in the tree above and the children of some of our neighbours who have been to day little john's visitors are playing below equally noisy and happy <\s>
<s> the green fields in the level area of the vale and part of the lake lie before me in quietness <\s>
<s> i have just been reading two newspapers full of factious brawls about lord melville and his delinquencies ravage of the french in the west indies victories of the english in the east fleets of ours roaming the sea in search of enemies whom they cannot find c <\s>
<s> c and i have asked myself more than once lately if my affections can be in the right place caring as i do so little about what the world seems to care so much for <\s>
<s> all this seems to me a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing <\s>
<s> it is pleasant in such a mood to turn one's thoughts to a good man and a dear friend <\s>
<s> i have therefore taken up the pen to write to you <\s>
<s> and first let me thank you which i ought to have done long ago and should have done but that i knew i had a licence from you to procrastinate for your most acceptable present of coleridge's portrait welcome in itself and more so as coming from you <\s>
<s> it is as good a resemblance as i expect to see of coleridge taking it all together for i consider c s as a face absolutely impracticable <\s>
<s> wordsworth was overjoyed at the sight of the print dorothy and i much pleased <\s>
<s> we think it excellent about the eyes and forehead which are the finest parts of c s face and the general contour of the face is well given but to my sister and me it seems to fail sadly about the middle of the face particularly at the bottom of the nose <\s>
<s> feels this also and my sister so much that except when she covers the whole of the middle of the face it seems to her so entirely to alter the expression as rather to confound than revive in her mind the remembrance of the original <\s>
<s> we think as far as mere likeness goes hazlitt's is better but the expression in hazlitt's is quite dolorous and funereal that in this is much more pleasing though certainly falling far below what one would wish to see infused into a picture of c <\s>
<s> received a day or two ago a letter from a friend who had letters from malta not from coleridge but a miss stoddart who is there with her brother <\s>
<s> these letters are of the date of the fifth of march and speak of him as looking well and quite well and talking of coming home but doubtful whether by land or sea <\s>
<s> i have the pleasure to say that i finished my poem about a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> i had looked forward to the day as a most happy one and i was indeed grateful to god for giving me life to complete the work such as it is <\s>
<s> but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about it the reality so far short of the expectation <\s>
<s> it was the first long labour that i had finished and the doubt whether i should ever live to write the recluse and the sense which i had of this poem being so far below what i seemed capable of executing depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me the joy which i should have had in showing him the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams <\s>
<s> i have spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the occasion being new <\s>
<s> this work may be considered as a sort of portico to the recluse part of the same building which i hope to be able ere long to begin with in earnest and if i am permitted to bring it to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic kind i shall consider the task of my life as over <\s>
<s> i ought to add that i have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as i apprehended <\s>
<s> i wish much to hear from you if you have leisure but as you are so indulgent to me it would be the highest injustice were i otherwise to you <\s>
<s> we have read madoc and been highly pleased with it <\s>
<s> it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much except perhaps young llewellyn whose situation is highly interesting and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece <\s>
<s> his speech to his uncle at their meeting in the island is particularly interesting <\s>
<s> the poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind imagination in the true sense of the word and knowledge of human nature and the human heart <\s>
<s> there is nothing that shows the hand of the great master but the beauties in description are innumerable for instance that of the figure of the bard towards the beginning of the convention of the bards receiving the poetic inspiration that of the wife of tlalala the savage going out to meet her husband that of madoc and the atzecan king with a long name preparing for battle everywhere indeed you have beautiful descriptions and it is a work which does the author high credit i think <\s>

<s> a linnet is singing in the tree above and the children of some of our neighbours who have been to day little john's visitors are playing below equally noisy and happy <\s>
<s> the green fields in the level area of the vale and part of the lake lie before me in quietness <\s>
<s> i have just been reading two newspapers full of factious brawls about lord melville and his delinquencies ravage of the french in the west indies victories of the english in the east fleets of ours roaming the sea in search of enemies whom they cannot find c <\s>
<s> c and i have asked myself more than once lately if my affections can be in the right place caring as i do so little about what the world seems to care so much for <\s>
<s> all this seems to me a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing <\s>
<s> it is pleasant in such a mood to turn one's thoughts to a good man and a dear friend <\s>
<s> i have therefore taken up the pen to write to you <\s>
<s> and first let me thank you which i ought to have done long ago and should have done but that i knew i had a licence from you to procrastinate for your most acceptable present of coleridge's portrait welcome in itself and more so as coming from you <\s>
<s> it is as good a resemblance as i expect to see of coleridge taking it all together for i consider c s as a face absolutely impracticable <\s>
<s> wordsworth was overjoyed at the sight of the print dorothy and i much pleased <\s>
<s> we think it excellent about the eyes and forehead which are the finest parts of c s face and the general contour of the face is well given but to my sister and me it seems to fail sadly about the middle of the face particularly at the bottom of the nose <\s>
<s> feels this also and my sister so much that except when she covers the whole of the middle of the face it seems to her so entirely to alter the expression as rather to confound than revive in her mind the remembrance of the original <\s>
<s> we think as far as mere likeness goes hazlitt's is better but the expression in hazlitt's is quite dolorous and funereal that in this is much more pleasing though certainly falling far below what one would wish to see infused into a picture of c <\s>
<s> received a day or two ago a letter from a friend who had letters from malta not from coleridge but a miss stoddart who is there with her brother <\s>
<s> these letters are of the date of the fifth of march and speak of him as looking well and quite well and talking of coming home but doubtful whether by land or sea <\s>
<s> i have the pleasure to say that i finished my poem about a fortnight ago <\s>
<s> i had looked forward to the day as a most happy one and i was indeed grateful to god for giving me life to complete the work such as it is <\s>
<s> but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about it the reality so far short of the expectation <\s>
<s> it was the first long labour that i had finished and the doubt whether i should ever live to write the recluse and the sense which i had of this poem being so far below what i seemed capable of executing depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me the joy which i should have had in showing him the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams <\s>
<s> i have spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the occasion being new <\s>
<s> this work may be considered as a sort of portico to the recluse part of the same building which i hope to be able ere long to begin with in earnest and if i am permitted to bring it to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic kind i shall consider the task of my life as over <\s>
<s> i ought to add that i have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as i apprehended <\s>
<s> i wish much to hear from you if you have leisure but as you are so indulgent to me it would be the highest injustice were i otherwise to you <\s>
<s> we have read madoc and been highly pleased with it <\s>
<s> it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much except perhaps young llewellyn whose situation is highly interesting and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece <\s>
<s> his speech to his uncle at their meeting in the island is particularly interesting <\s>
<s> the poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind imagination in the true sense of the word and knowledge of human nature and the human heart <\s>
<s> there is nothing that shows the hand of the great master but the beauties in description are innumerable for instance that of the figure of the bard towards the beginning of the convention of the bards receiving the poetic inspiration that of the wife of tlalala the savage going out to meet her husband that of madoc and the atzecan king with a long name preparing for battle everywhere indeed you have beautiful descriptions and it is a work which does the author high credit i think <\s>
<s> i should like to know your opinion of it <\s>
<s> best remembrances and love to lady beaumont <\s>
<s> believe me my dear sir george your most sincere friend w <\s>
<s> my sister thanks lady beaumont for her letter and will write in a few days <\s>
<s> i find that lady b <\s>

<s> to sir george h <\s>
<s> 1805 my dear sir george we have all here been made happy in hearing that you are so much better <\s>
<s> i write now chiefly on account of a mistake which you seem to be under concerning coleridge <\s>
<s> i guess from your letter that you suppose him to be appointed to the place of secretary to sir a <\s>
<s> this is by no means the case <\s>
<s> he is an occasional substitute for mr <\s>
<s> chapman who is secretary and no doubt must have resumed his office long before this as he had been expected every day some time before the date of c s last letter <\s>
<s> the paragraph in the paper which we also saw positively states that c <\s>
