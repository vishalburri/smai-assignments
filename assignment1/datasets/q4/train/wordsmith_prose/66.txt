<s> southey has thus accurately characterised the peculiarity of this music while we were at the waterfall some half score peasants chiefly women and girls assembled just out of reach of the spring and set up surely the wildest chorus that ever was heard by human ears a song not of articulate sounds but in which the voice was used as a mere instrument of music more flexible than any which art could produce sweet powerful and thrilling beyond description see notes to a tale of paraguay <\s>
