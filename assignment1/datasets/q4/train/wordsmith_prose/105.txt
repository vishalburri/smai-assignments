<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>

<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>

<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>

<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>

<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>
<s> my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times <\s>

<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>

<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>

<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>

<s> the above written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my father in 1833 with wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads <\s>
<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>

<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>

<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>
<s> all at once the trouble would pass away and his countenance bask in its habitual calm like a cloudless summer sky <\s>
<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>

<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>

<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>

<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>

<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>

<s> the above written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my father in 1833 with wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads <\s>
<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>
<s> my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times <\s>
<s> much surprised i asked and what may his special merits be <\s>

<s> a wider conception of poetry had become mine and the byronian enthusiasm fell from me like a bond that is broken by being outgrown <\s>
<s> the incident illustrates poetry in one of its many characters that of the deliverer <\s>
<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>
<s> till the cloud had drifted he could see nothing beyond <\s>
<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>
<s> all at once the trouble would pass away and his countenance bask in its habitual calm like a cloudless summer sky <\s>
<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>

<s> the above written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my father in 1833 with wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads <\s>
<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>

<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>

<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>
<s> all at once the trouble would pass away and his countenance bask in its habitual calm like a cloudless summer sky <\s>
<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>

<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>
<s> my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times <\s>

<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>

<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>

<s> the above written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my father in 1833 with wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads <\s>
<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>

<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>

<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>
<s> all at once the trouble would pass away and his countenance bask in its habitual calm like a cloudless summer sky <\s>
<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>

<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>

<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>

<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>

<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>

<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>
<s> my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times <\s>
<s> much surprised i asked and what may his special merits be <\s>

<s> he chanced to be then under the immediate spell of one of those fits of poetic inspiration which descended on him like a cloud <\s>

<s> under the level of the calm there was however the precinct of the storm <\s>
<s> it expressed itself rarely but vehemently partaking sometimes of the character both of indignation and sorrow <\s>

<s> his indignation flamed out vehemently when he heard of a base action <\s>
<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>

<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>

<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>
<s> he regarded his own intellect as one which united some of the faculties which belong to the statesman with those which belong to the poet and public affairs interested him not less deeply than poetry <\s>
<s> it was as patriot not poet that he ventured to claim fellowship with dante 271 he did not accept the term reformer because it implied an organic change in our institutions and this he deemed both needless and dangerous but he used to say that while he was a decided conservative he remembered that to preserve our institutions we must be ever improving them <\s>
<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>
<s> till disenchanted by the excesses and follies of the first french revolution his hopes and sympathies associated themselves ardently with the new order of things created by it and i have heard him say that he did not know how any generous minded young man entering on life at the time of that great uprising could have escaped the illusion <\s>
<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>

<s> i could kick such a man across england with my naked foot i heard him exclaim on such an occasion <\s>
<s> the more impassioned part of his nature connected itself especially with his political feelings <\s>

<s> he was indeed from first to last preëminently a patriot an impassioned as well as a thoughtful one <\s>
<s> yet his political sympathies were not with his own country only but with the progress of humanity <\s>

<s> to the end his sympathies were ever with the cottage hearth far more than with the palace <\s>
<s> if he became a strong supporter of what has been called the hierarchy of society it was chiefly because he believed the principle of equality to be fatal to the well being and the true dignity of the poor <\s>
<s> moreover in siding politically with the crown and the coronets he considered himself to be siding with the weaker party in our democratic days <\s>
<s> 271 see his sonnet on the seat of dante close to the duomo at florence poems of early and late years <\s>
<s> the absence of love poetry in wordsworth's works has often been remarked upon and indeed brought as a charge against them <\s>
<s> he once told me that if he had avoided that form of composition it was by no means because the theme did not interest him but because treated as it commonly has been it tends rather to disturb and lower the reader's moral and imaginative being than to elevate it <\s>
<s> he feared to handle it amiss <\s>
<s> he seemed to think that the subject had been so long vulgarised that few poets had a right to assume that they could treat it worthily especially as the theme when treated unworthily was such an easy and cheap way of winning applause <\s>
<s> it has been observed also that the religion of wordsworth's poetry at least of his earlier poetry is not as distinctly revealed religion as might have been expected from this poet's well known adherence to what he has called emphatically the lord and mighty paramount of truths <\s>
<s> he once remarked to me himself on this circumstance and explained it by stating that when in youth his imagination was shaping for itself the channel in which it was to flow his religious convictions were less definite and less strong than they had become on more mature thought and that when his poetic mind and manner had once been formed he feared that he might in attempting to modify them have become constrained <\s>
<s> he added that on such matters he ever wrote with great diffidence remembering that if there were many subjects too low for song there were some too high <\s>
<s> wordsworth's general confidence in his own powers which was strong though far from exaggerated rendered more striking and more touching his humility in all that concerned religion <\s>
<s> it used to remind me of what i once heard mr <\s>
<s> there is a special character of greatness about humility for it implies that a man can in an unusual degree estimate the greatness of what is above us <\s>
<s> fortunately his diffidence did not keep wordsworth silent on sacred themes his later poems include an unequivocal as well as beautiful confession of christian faith and one of them the primrose of the rock is as distinctly wordsworthian in its inspiration as it is christian in its doctrine <\s>
<s> wordsworth was a high churchman and also in his prose mind strongly anti roman catholic partly on political grounds but that it was otherwise as regards his mind poetic is obvious from many passages in his christian poetry especially those which refer to the monastic system and the schoolmen and his sonnet on the blessed virgin whom he addresses as our tainted nature's solitary boast <\s>
<s> he used to say that the idea of one who was both virgin and mother had sunk so deep into the heart of humanity that there it must ever remain <\s>
<s> wordsworth's estimate of his contemporaries was not generally high <\s>
<s> i remember his once saying to me i have known many that might he called very clever men and a good many of real and vigorous abilities but few of genius and only one whom i should call wonderful <\s>
<s> that one was coleridge <\s>
<s> at any hour of the day or night he would talk by the hour if there chanced to be any sympathetic listener and talk better than the best page of his writings for a pen half paralysed his genius <\s>
<s> a child would sit quietly at his feet and wonder till the torrent had passed by <\s>
<s> the only man like coleridge whom i have known is sir william hamilton astronomer royal of dublin <\s>
<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> i remember however that when i recited by his fireside alfred tennyson's two political poems you ask me why though ill at ease and of old sat freedom on the heights the old bard listened with a deepening attention and when i had ended said after a pause i must acknowledge that those two poems are very solid and noble in thought <\s>
<s> their diction also seems singularly stately <\s>
<s> he was a great admirer of philip van artevelde <\s>
<s> in the case of a certain poet since dead and never popular he said to me i consider his sonnets to be the best of modern times adding of course i am not including my own in any comparison with those of others <\s>
<s> he was not sanguine as to the future of english poetry <\s>
<s> he thought that there was much to be supplied in other departments of our literature and especially he desired a really great history of england but he was disposed to regard the roll of english poetry as made up and as leaving place for little more except what was likely to be eccentric or imitational <\s>
<s> in his younger days wordsworth had had to fight a great battle in poetry for both his subjects and his mode of treating them were antagonistic to the maxims then current <\s>
<s> it was fortunate for posterity no doubt that his long militant estate was animated by some mingling of personal ambition with his love of poetry <\s>
<s> speaking in an early sonnet of the poets who on earth have made us heirs of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays he concludes oh <\s>
<s> might my name be numbered among theirs then gladly would i end my mortal days <\s>
<s> he died at eighty and general fame did not come to him till about fifteen years before his death <\s>
<s> this perhaps might have been fifteen years too soon if he had set any inordinate value on it <\s>
<s> but it was not so <\s>
<s> shelley tells us that fame is love disguised and it was intellectual sympathy that wordsworth had always valued far more than reputation <\s>
<s> give me thy love i claim no other fee had been his demand on his reader <\s>
<s> when fame had laid her tardy garland at his feet he found on it no fresher green than his rydalian laurels had always worn <\s>
<s> once he said to me it is indeed a deep satisfaction to hope and believe that my poetry will be while it lasts a help to the cause of virtue and truth especially among the young <\s>
<s> as for myself it seems now of little moment how long i may be remembered <\s>
<s> when a man pushes off in his little boat into the great seas of infinity and eternity it surely signifies little how long he is kept in sight by watchers from the shore <\s>
<s> such are my chief recollections of the great poet whom i knew but in his old age but whose heart retained its youth till his daughter dora's death <\s>
<s> he seemed to me one who from boyhood had been faithful to a high vocation one who had esteemed it his office to minister in an age of conventional civilisation at nature's altar and who had in his later life explained and vindicated such life long ministration even while he seemed to apologise for it in the memorable confession but who is innocent <\s>
<s> by grace divine not otherwise o nature are we thine 272 272 evening voluntary <\s>
<s> it was to nature as first created not to nature as corrupted by disnatured passions that his song had attributed such high and healing powers <\s>
<s> in singing her praise he had chosen a theme loftier than most of his readers knew loftier as he perhaps eventually discovered than he had at first supposed it to be <\s>
<s> utterly without shakspeare's dramatic faculty he was richer and wider in the humanities than any poet since shakspeare <\s>
<s> wholly unlike milton in character and in opinions he abounds in passages to be paralleled only by milton in solemn and spiritual sublimity and not even by milton in pathos <\s>
<s> it was plain to those who knew wordsworth that he had kept his great gift pure and used it honestly and thoroughly for that purpose for which it had been bestowed <\s>
<s> he had ever written with a conscientious reverence for that gift but he had also written spontaneously <\s>
<s> he had composed with care not the exaggerated solicitude which is prompted by vanity and which frets itself to unite incompatible excellences but the diligence which shrinks from no toil while eradicating blemishes that confuse a poem's meaning and frustrate its purpose <\s>
<s> he regarded poetry as an art but he also regarded art not as the compeer of nature much less her superior but as her servant and interpreter <\s>
<s> he wrote poetry likewise no doubt in a large measure because self utterance was an essential law of his nature <\s>
<s> if he had a companion he discoursed like one whose thoughts must needs run on in audible current if he walked alone among his mountains he murmured old songs <\s>
<s> he was like a pine grove vocal as well as visible <\s>
<s> but to poetry he had dedicated himself as to the utterance of the highest truths brought within the range of his life's experience and if his poetry has been accused of egotism the charge has come from those who did not perceive that it was with a human not a mere personal interest that he habitually watched the processes of his own mind <\s>
<s> he drew from the fountain that was nearest at hand what he hoped might be a refreshment to those far off <\s>
<s> he once said speaking of a departed man of genius who had lived an unhappy life and deplorably abused his powers to the lasting calamity of his country a great poet must be a great man and a great man must be a good man and a good man ought to be a happy man <\s>
<s> to know wordsworth was to feel sure that if he had been a great poet it was not merely because he had been endowed with a great imagination but because he had been a good man a great man and a man whose poetry had in an especial sense been the expression of a healthily happy moral being <\s>

<s> lone lakes rills gushing through rock rooted trees peaked mountains shadowing vales of peacefulness glens echoing to the flashing waterfall <\s>

<s> with friends delayed beside a ferny bank neath oaks and yews the moon between two mountain peaks embayed heaven and the waters dyed with sunset hues and he the poet of the age and land discoursing as we wandered hand in hand <\s>
<s> the above written sonnet is the record of a delightful day spent by my father in 1833 with wordsworth at rydal to which he went from the still more beautiful shores of ulswater where he had been sojourning at halsteads <\s>
<s> he had been one of wordsworth's warmest admirers when their number was small and in 1842 he dedicated a volume of poems to him 273 he taught me when a boy of 18 years old to admire the great bard <\s>
<s> i had been very enthusiastically praising lord byron's poetry <\s>
<s> my father calmly replied wordsworth is the great poet of modern times <\s>
<s> much surprised i asked and what may his special merits be <\s>
<s> the answer was they are very various as for instance depth largeness elevation and what is rare in modern poetry an entire purity <\s>
<s> in his noble laodamia they are chiefly majesty and pathos <\s>
<s> a few weeks afterwards i chanced to take from the library shelves a volume of wordsworth and it opened on laodamia <\s>
<s> some strong calm hand seemed to have been laid on my head and bound me to the spot till i had come to the end <\s>
<s> as i read a new world hitherto unimagined opened itself out stretching far away into serene infinitudes <\s>
<s> the region was one to me unknown but the harmony of the picture attested its reality <\s>
<s> above and around were indeed 273 a song of faith devout exercises and sonnets pickering <\s>
<s> the dedication closed thus i may at least hope to be named hereafter among the friends of wordsworth <\s>
<s> an ampler ether a diviner air and fields invested with purpureal gleams and when i reached the line calm pleasures there abide majestic pains i felt that no tenants less stately could walk in so lordly a precinct <\s>
<s> i had been translated into another planet of song one with larger movements and a longer year <\s>
<s> a wider conception of poetry had become mine and the byronian enthusiasm fell from me like a bond that is broken by being outgrown <\s>
<s> the incident illustrates poetry in one of its many characters that of the deliverer <\s>
