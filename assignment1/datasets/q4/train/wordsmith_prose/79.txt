<s> for what seemed best to me worth recording in this tour see the poem of my own life 19 after taking my degree in january 1791 i went to london stayed there some time and then visited my friend jones who resided in the yale of clwydd north wales <\s>
<s> along with him i made a pedestrian tour through north wales for which also see the poem 20 in the autumn of 1791 i went to paris where i stayed some little time and then went to orleans with a view of being out of the way of my own countrymen that i might learn to speak the language fluently <\s>
<s> at orleans and blois and paris on my return i passed fifteen or sixteen months 21 it was a stirring time <\s>
<s> the king was dethroned when i was at blois and the massacres of september took place when i was at orleans <\s>
<s> but for these matters see also the poem <\s>
<s> i came home before the execution of the king and passed the subsequent time among my friends in london and elsewhere till i settled with my only sister at piacedown in dorsetshire in the year 1796 <\s>

<s> here we were visited by mr <\s>
<s> coleridge then residing at bristol and for the sake of being near him when he had removed to nether stowey in somersetshire we removed to alfoxden three miles from that place <\s>
<s> this was a very pleasant and productive time of my life <\s>
<s> coleridge my sister and i set off on a tour to linton and other places in devonshire and in order to defray his part of the expense coleridge on the same afternoon commenced his poem of the ancient mariner in which i was to have borne my part and a few verses were written by me and some assistance given in planning the poem but our styles agreed so little that i withdrew from the concern and he finished it himself <\s>
<s> in the course of that spring i composed many poems most of which were printed at bristol in one volume by my friend joseph cottle along with coleridge's ancient mariner and two or three other of his pieces <\s>
<s> in the autumn of 1798 mr <\s>
<s> coleridge a friend of his mr <\s>
<s> chester my sister and i crossed from yarmouth to hamburgh where we remained a few days and saw several times klopstock the poet <\s>
<s> coleridge and his friend went to ratzburg in the north of germany and my sister and i preferred going southward and for the sake of cheapness and the neighbourhood of the hartz mountains we spent the winter at the old imperial city of goslar <\s>
<s> the winter was perishingly cold the coldest of this century and the good people with whom we lodged told me one morning that they expected to find me frozen to death my little sleeping room being immediately over an archway <\s>
<s> however neither my sister nor i took any harm <\s>
<s> we returned to england in the following spring and went to visit our friends the hutchinsons at sockburn on tees in the county of durham with whom we remained till the 19th of december <\s>
<s> we then came on st <\s>
<s> thomas's day the 21st to a small cottage at town end grasmere which in the course of a tour some months previously with mr <\s>
<s> coleridge i had been pleased with and had hired <\s>
<s> this we furnished for about a hundred pounds which sum had come to my sister by a legacy from her uncle crackanthorp <\s>
<s> i fell to composition immediately and published in 1800 the second volume of the lyrical ballads <\s>
<s> in the year 1802 i married mary hutchinson at brompton near scarborough to which part of the country the family had removed from sockburn <\s>
<s> we had known each other from childhood and had practised reading and spelling under the same old dame at penrith a remarkable personage who had taught three generations of the upper classes principally of the town of penrith and its neighbourhood <\s>
<s> after our marriage we dwelt together with our sister at town end where three of our children were born <\s>
<s> in the spring of 1808 the increase of our family caused us to remove to a larger house then just built allan bank in the same vale where our two younger children were born and who died at the rectory the house we afterwards occupied for two years <\s>
<s> they died in 1812 and in 1813 we came to rydal mount where we have since lived with no further sorrow till 1836 when my sister became a confirmed invalid and our sister sarah hutchinson died <\s>
<s> she lived alternately with her brother and with us 22 2 <\s>
<s> the old dame did not affect to make theologians or logicians but she taught to read and she practised the memory often no doubt by rote but still the faculty was improved <\s>
<s> something perhaps she explained and left the rest to parents to masters and to the pastor of the parish 23 3 <\s>

<s> my dear sister my last letter was addressed to you from st <\s>
<s> valier and the grande chartreuse <\s>
<s> i have since that period gone over a very considerable tract of country and i will give you a sketch of my route as far as relates to mentioning places where i have been after i have assured you that i am in excellent health and spirits and have had no reason to complain of the contrary during our whole tour <\s>
<s> my spirits have been kept in a perpetual hurry of delight by the almost uninterrupted succession of sublime and beautiful objects which have passed before my eyes during the course of the last mouth <\s>
<s> i will endeavour to give you some idea of our route <\s>
<s> it will be utterly impossible for me to dwell upon particular scenes as my paper would be exhausted before i had done with the journey of two or three days <\s>
<s> on quitting the grande chartreuse where we remained two days contemplating with increased pleasure its wonderful scenery we passed through savoy to geneva thence along the pays do vaud side of the lake to villeneuve a small town seated at its head <\s>
<s> the lower part of the lake did not afford us a pleasure equal to what might have been expected from its celebrity this owing partly to its width and partly to the weather which was one of those hot gleamy days in which all distant objects are veiled in a species of bright obscurity <\s>
<s> but the higher part of the lake made us ample amends tis true we had some disagreeable weather but the banks of the water are infinitely more picturesque and as it is much narrower the landscape suffered proportionally less from that pale steam which before almost entirely hid the opposite shore <\s>
<s> from villeneuve we proceeded up the rhone to martigny where we left our bundles and struck over the mountains to chamouny and visited the glaciers of savoy <\s>
<s> you have undoubtedly heard of these celebrated scenes but if you have not read about them any description which i have room to give you must be altogether inadequate <\s>
<s> after passing two days in the environs of chamouny we returned to martigny and pursued our mount up the valais along the rhine to brig <\s>
<s> at brig we quitted the valais and passed the alps at the simplon in order to visit part of italy <\s>
<s> the impressions of three hours of our walk among these alps will never be effaced <\s>
<s> from duomo d'ossola a town of italy which lay in our route we proceeded to the lake of locarno to visit the boromean islands and thence to como <\s>
<s> a more charming path was scarcely ever travelled over <\s>
<s> the banks of many of the italian and swiss lakes are so steep and rocky as not to admit of roads that of como is partly of this character <\s>
<s> a small foot path is all the communication by land between one village and another on the side along which we passed for upwards of thirty miles <\s>
<s> we entered upon this path about noon and owing to the steepness of the banks were soon unmolested by the sun which illuminated the woods rocks and villages of the opposite shore <\s>
<s> the lake is narrow and the shadows of the mountains were early thrown across it <\s>
<s> it was beautiful to watch them travelling up the side of the hills for several hours to remark one half of a village covered with shade and the other bright with the strongest sunshine <\s>
<s> it was with regret that we passed every turn of this charming path where every new picture was purchased by the loss of another which we should never have been tired of gazing upon <\s>
<s> the shores of the lake consist of steeps covered with large sweeping woods of chestnut spotted with villages some clinging from the summits of the advancing rocks and others hiding themselves within their recesses <\s>
<s> nor was the surface of the lake less interesting than its shores half of it glowing with the richest green and gold the reflection of the illuminated wood and path shaded with a soft blue tint <\s>
<s> the picture was still further diversified by the number of sails which stole lazily by us as we paused in the wood above them <\s>
<s> after all this we had the moon <\s>
