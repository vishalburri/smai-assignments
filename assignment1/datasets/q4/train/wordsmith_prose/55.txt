<s> 10 ): these verses were written some time after we had become resident at rydal mount and i will take occasion from them to observe upon the beauty of that situation as being backed and flanked by lofty fells which bring the heavenly bodies to touch as it were the earth upon the mountain tops while the prospect in front lies open to a length of level valley the extended lake and a terminating ridge of low hills so that it gives an opportunity to the inhabitants of the place of noticing the stars in both the positions here alluded to namely on the tops of the mountains and as winter lamps at a distance among the leafless trees <\s>
<s> prelude to the last volume <\s>
<s> as supra these verses were begun while i was on a visit to my son john at brigham and finished at rydal <\s>
<s> as the contents of this volume to which they are now prefixed will be assigned to their respective classes when my poems shall be collected in one vol i should be at a loss where with propriety to place this prelude being too restricted in its bearing to serve as a preface for the whole <\s>
<s> the lines towards the conclusion allude to the discontents then fomented thro the country by the agitators of the anti corn law league the particular causes of such troubles are transitory but disposition to excite and liability to be excited are nevertheless permanent and therefore proper objects of the poet's regard <\s>
<s> poems written in youth <\s>

<s> the beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while i was resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of sycamores which then extended their branches from the shore of the promontory upon which stands the ancient and at that time the more picturesque hall of coniston the seat of the le flemings from very early times <\s>
<s> the poem of which it was the conclusion was of many hundred lines and contained thoughts and images most of which have been dispersed through my other writings <\s>
<s> of the poems in this class the evening walk and descriptive sketches were first published in 1793 <\s>
<s> they are reprinted with some alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their publication <\s>
<s> this notice which was written some time ago scarcely applies to the poem descriptive sketches as it now stands <\s>
<s> the corrections though numerous are not however such as to prevent its retaining with propriety a place in the class of juvenile pieces <\s>
<s> addressed to a young lady <\s>
<s> iii the young lady to whom this was addressed was my sister <\s>
<s> it was composed at school and during my first two college vacations <\s>
<s> there is not an image in it which i have not observed and now in my seventy third year i recollect the time and place where most of them were noticed <\s>
<s> i will confine myself to one instance <\s>
<s> waving his hat the shepherd from the vale directs his wandering dog the cliffs to scale the dog bounds barking mid the glittering rocks hunts where his master points the intercepted flocks <\s>
<s> i was an eye witness of this for the first time while crossing the pass of dunmail raise <\s>
<s> upon second thought i will mention another image and fronting the bright west yon oak entwines its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines <\s>
<s> this is feebly and imperfectly exprest but i recollect distinctly the very spot where this first struck me <\s>
<s> it was on the way between hawkshead and ambleside and gave me extreme pleasure <\s>
<s> the moment was important in my poetical history for i date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country so far as i was acquainted with them and i made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency <\s>
<s> i could not have been at that time above fourteen years of age <\s>
<s> the description of the swans that follows was taken from the daily opportunities i had of observing their habits not as confined to the gentleman's park but in a state of nature <\s>
<s> there were two pairs of them that divided the lake of esthwaite and its in and out flowing streams between them never trespassing a single yard upon each other's separate domain <\s>
<s> they were of the old magnificent species bearing in beauty and majesty about the same relation to the thames swan which that does to a goose <\s>
<s> it was from the remembrance of these noble creatures i took thirty years after the picture of the swan which i have discarded from the poem of dion <\s>
<s> while i was a school boy the late mr <\s>
<s> curwen introduced a little fleet of these birds but of the inferior species to the lake of windermere <\s>
<s> their principal home was about his own islands but they sailed about into remote parts of the lake and either from real or imagined injury done to the adjoining fields they were got rid of at the request of the farmers and proprietors but to the great regret of all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and quiet habits <\s>
<s> i will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place a proof of which i was unconscious at the time of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance <\s>
<s> the country is idealized rather than described in any one of its local aspects <\s>
<s> when horses in the sunburnt intake stood <\s>
<s> the word intake is local and signifies a mountain enclosure <\s>
<s> brightens with water brooks the hollow ghyll <\s>
<s> ghyll is also i believe a term confined to this country ghyll and dingle have the same meaning <\s>
<s> gives one bright glance and drops behind the hill <\s>
<s> lines written while sailing in a boat at evening <\s>
<s> this title is scarcely correct <\s>
<s> it was during a solitary walk on the banks of the cam that i was first struck with this appearance and applied it to my own feelings in the manner here expressed changing the scene to the thames near windsor <\s>
<s> this and the three stanzas of the following poem remembrance of collins formed one piece but upon the recommendation of coleridge the three last stanzas were separated from the other <\s>
<s> descriptive sketches taken during a pedestrian tour among the alps <\s>

<s> dear sir however desirous i might have been of giving you proofs of the high place you hold in my esteem i should have been cautious of wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you had not the circumstance of our having been companions among the alps seemed to give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which your modesty might otherwise have suggested <\s>
<s> in inscribing this little work to you i consult my heart <\s>
<s> you know well how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a post chaise and two travellers plodding slowly along the road side by side each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders <\s>
<s> how much more of heart between the two latter <\s>
<s> i am happy in being conscious that i shall have one reader who will approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret <\s>
<s> you they must certainly interest in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of melancholy <\s>
<s> you will meet with few images without recollecting the spot where we observed them together consequently whatever is feeble in my design or spiritless in my colouring will be amply supplied by your own memory <\s>
<s> with still greater propriety i might have inscribed to you a description of some of the features of your native mountains through which we have wandered together in the same manner with so much pleasure <\s>
<s> but the sea sunsets which give such splendour to the vale of clwyd snowdon the chair of idris the quiet village of bethgelert menai and her druids the alpine steeps of the conway and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the dee remain yet untouched <\s>
<s> apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects i cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how much affection and esteem i am dear sir most sincerely yours w <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks upon the banks of the loire in the years 1791 1792 <\s>
<s> i will only notice that the description of the valley filled with mist beginning in solemn shapes c <\s>
<s> was taken from that beautiful region of which the principal features are lungarn and sarnen <\s>
<s> nothing that i ever saw in nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which i have attempted alas how feebly <\s>
<s> to convey to others in these lines <\s>
<s> those two lakes have always interested me especially from bearing in their size and other features a resemblance to those of the north of england <\s>
<s> it is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should be so unhealthy as it is <\s>

<s> lines left upon a seat in a yew tree which stands near the lake of esthwaite on a desolate part of the shore commanding a beautiful prospect vii composed in part at school at hawkshead <\s>
<s> the tree has disappeared and the slip of common on which it stood that ran parallel to the lake and lay open to it has long been enclosed so that the road has lost much of its attraction <\s>
<s> this spot was my favourite walk in the evenings during the latter part of my school time <\s>
<s> the individual whose habits and character are here given was a gentleman of the neighbourhood a man of talent and learning who had been educated at one of our universities and returned to pass his time in seclusion on his own estate <\s>
<s> he died a bachelor in middle age <\s>
<s> induced by the beauty of the prospect he built a small summer house on the rocks above the peninsula on which the ferry house stands <\s>

<s> the site was long ago pointed out by mr <\s>

<s> so much used i to be delighted with the view from it while a little boy that some years before the first pleasure house was built i led thither from hawkshead a youngster about my own age an irish boy who was a servant to an itinerant conjuror <\s>
<s> my motive was to witness the pleasure i expected the boy would receive from the prospect of the islands below and the intermingling water <\s>
<s> i was not disappointed and i hope the fact insignificant as it may seem to some may be thought worthy of note by others who may cast their eye over these notes <\s>
