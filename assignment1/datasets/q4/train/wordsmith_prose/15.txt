<s> that they were armed is a proof that they had an intention to do so as one of our journals observed ): but what encouragement had they in that intention from the sight of a regular force more than 30,000 strong abandoning without a struggle passes where as an english general asserts a body of a thousand men might stop an army of twenty times the number <\s>

<s> to this charge in so far as it may be thought to criminate the spaniards a full answer is furnished by their accuser himself in the following memorable sentence in another part of the very same letter i am sorry to say that the army whose conduct i had such reason to extol in its march through portugal and on its arrival in spain has totally changed its character since it began to retreat <\s>

<s> having thus shewn that in sir j <\s>
<s> moore's very inaccurate statements of facts we have some further reasons for a previous distrust of any opinion which is supported by those statements it is now time to make the reader acquainted with the real terms and extent of that opinion <\s>
<s> for it is far less to be feared that from his just respect for him who gave it he should allow it an undue weight in his judgment than that reposing on the faithfulness of the abstracts and reports of these letters he should really be still ignorant of its exact tenor <\s>
<s> the whole amount then of what sir john moore has alleged against the spaniards in any place but one is comprised in this sentence the enthusiasm of which we have heard so much no where appears whatever good will there is and i believe amongst the lower orders there is a great deal is taken no advantage of <\s>
<s> it is true that in that one place viz <\s>
<s> in his last letter written at corunna he charges the spaniards with apathy and indifference but as this cannot be reconciled with his concession of a great deal of good will we are bound to take that as his real and deliberate opinion which he gave under circumstances that allowed him most coolness and freedom of judgment the spaniards then were wanting in enthusiasm <\s>
<s> now what is meant by enthusiasm <\s>
<s> does it mean want of ardour and zeal in battle <\s>
<s> moore no where asserts and even without a direct acknowledgement of their good conduct in the field of which he had indeed no better means of judging than we in england there is involved in his statement of the relative numbers of the french and spaniards combined with our knowledge of the time during which they maintained their struggle a sufficient testimony to that even if the events of the first campaign had not made it superfluous <\s>
<s> does it mean then a want of good will to the cause <\s>
<s> so far from this we have seen that sir j m <\s>
<s> admits that there was in that class where it was most wanted a great deal of good will <\s>
<s> and in the present condition of spain let it be recollected what it is that this implies <\s>
<s> we see in the intercepted letter to marshal soult transmitted by sir j m that the french keep accurate registers of the behaviour of the different towns and this was no doubt well known throughout spain <\s>
<s> therefore to shew any signs of good will much more to give a kind welcome to the english as had been done at badajoz and salamanca was they knew a pledge of certain punishment on any visit from the french <\s>
<s> so that good will manifested in these circumstances was nothing less than a testimony of devotion to the cause <\s>
<s> here then the reader will say i find granted in the courage and the good will of the spaniards all the elements of an enthusiastic resistance and cannot therefore imagine what more could be sought for except the throwing out and making palpable of their enthusiasm to the careless eye in some signal outward manifestations <\s>
<s> in this accordingly we learn what interpretation we are to give to sir j m s charge there were no tumults on his entrance into spain no insurrections they did not as he says rally round the english army <\s>
<s> but to determine how far this disappointment of his expectations tells against the spaniards we must first know how far those expectations were reasonable <\s>
<s> let the reader consider then first what army was this round which the spaniards were to rally <\s>
<s> if it was known by the victory of vimiera it was known also to many by the convention of cintra for though the government had never ventured to communicate that affair officially to the nation dark and perplexing whispers were however circulated about it throughout spain <\s>
<s> moreover it must surely demand some superstition in behalf of regular troops to see in an army of 20,000 men a dignity adequate to the office here claimed for it of awakening a new vigour and enthusiasm in such a nation as spain not to mention that an english army however numerous had no right to consider itself as other than a tributary force as itself tending to a centre and attracted rather than attracting <\s>
<s> secondly it appears that sir j m <\s>
<s> has overlooked one most important circumstance viz <\s>
<s> that the harvest in these provinces had been already reaped the english army could be viewed only as gleaners <\s>

<s> the first of these charges is the most important i give it to the reader in the words of sir john moore the french cavalry from burgos in small detachments are over running the province of león raising contributions to which the inhabitants submit without the least resistance <\s>

<s> brodrick why there was no resistance at that time i was not aware how remarkably the plains of león and castille differ from any other i have seen nor how strongly the circumstances which constitute that difference enforce the opinion i venture to express <\s>

<s> that they were armed is a proof that they had an intention to do so as one of our journals observed ): but what encouragement had they in that intention from the sight of a regular force more than 30,000 strong abandoning without a struggle passes where as an english general asserts a body of a thousand men might stop an army of twenty times the number <\s>
<s> the third charge relates to the same province it is a complaint that the people run away the villages are deserted and again in his last letter they abandoned their dwellings at our approach drove away their carts oxen and every thing which could be of the smallest aid to the army <\s>

<s> the english army then treated its ally as an enemy and though there are alleviations of its conduct in its great sufferings yet it must be remembered that these sufferings were due not to the gallicians but to circumstances over which they had no controul to the precipitancy of the retreat the inclemency of the weather and the poverty of the country and that knowing this they must have had a double sense of injustice in any outrages of an english army from contrasting them with the professed objects of that army in entering spain it is to be observed that the answer to the second charge would singly have been some answer to this and reciprocally that the answer to this is a full answer to the second <\s>

<s> in his last letter written at corunna he charges the spaniards with apathy and indifference but as this cannot be reconciled with his concession of a great deal of good will we are bound to take that as his real and deliberate opinion which he gave under circumstances that allowed him most coolness and freedom of judgment the spaniards then were wanting in enthusiasm <\s>
<s> now what is meant by enthusiasm <\s>
<s> does it mean want of ardour and zeal in battle <\s>
<s> moore no where asserts and even without a direct acknowledgement of their good conduct in the field of which he had indeed no better means of judging than we in england there is involved in his statement of the relative numbers of the french and spaniards combined with our knowledge of the time during which they maintained their struggle a sufficient testimony to that even if the events of the first campaign had not made it superfluous <\s>

<s> and further it shall now be shewn that even those three charges which sir j m <\s>
<s> does allege in proof of his opinions are as glaringly mis stated <\s>
<s> the first of these charges is the most important i give it to the reader in the words of sir john moore the french cavalry from burgos in small detachments are over running the province of león raising contributions to which the inhabitants submit without the least resistance <\s>
<s> now here it cannot be meant that no efforts at resistance were made by individuals or small parties because this would not only contradict the universal laws of human nature but would also be at utter variance with sir j m s repeated complaints that he could gain no information of what was passing in his neighbourhood <\s>
<s> it is meant therefore that there was no regular organised resistance no resistance such as might be made the subject of an official report <\s>
<s> now we all know that the spaniards have every where suffered deplorably from a want of cavalry and in the absence of that hear from a military man major gen <\s>
<s> brodrick why there was no resistance at that time i was not aware how remarkably the plains of león and castille differ from any other i have seen nor how strongly the circumstances which constitute that difference enforce the opinion i venture to express <\s>
<s> he means the necessity of cavalry reinforcements from england my road from astorga lay through a vast open space extending from 5 to 20 or more miles on every side without a single accident of ground which could enable a body of infantry to check a pursuing enemy or to cover its own retreat <\s>
<s> in such ground any corps of infantry might be insulted to the very gates of the town it occupied by cavalry far inferior in numbers contributions raised under their eyes and the whole neighbourhood exhausted of its resources without the possibility of their opposing any resistance to such incursions <\s>
<s> the second charge is made on the retreat to corunna the gallicians though armed sir j m <\s>
<s> says made no attempt to stop the passage of the french through the mountains <\s>
<s> that they were armed is a proof that they had an intention to do so as one of our journals observed ): but what encouragement had they in that intention from the sight of a regular force more than 30,000 strong abandoning without a struggle passes where as an english general asserts a body of a thousand men might stop an army of twenty times the number <\s>
<s> the third charge relates to the same province it is a complaint that the people run away the villages are deserted and again in his last letter they abandoned their dwellings at our approach drove away their carts oxen and every thing which could be of the smallest aid to the army <\s>
<s> to this charge in so far as it may be thought to criminate the spaniards a full answer is furnished by their accuser himself in the following memorable sentence in another part of the very same letter i am sorry to say that the army whose conduct i had such reason to extol in its march through portugal and on its arrival in spain has totally changed its character since it began to retreat <\s>
<s> what do we collect from this passage <\s>

<s> the main strength and efforts of the french were at the opening of the campaign directed against the army of gen <\s>

<s> blake for the purpose of forming a junction with the second division and the army of asturias that the army should make long rapid and continued marches through a country at any time incapable of feeding so numerous an army and at present almost totally drained of provisions <\s>
<s> from the 30th of october to the present day nov <\s>
<s> 6 with the exception of a small and partial issue of bread at bilboa on the morning of the 1st of november this army has been totally destitute of bread wine or spirits and has literally lived on the scanty supply of beef and sheep which those mountains afford <\s>
<s> yet never was there a symptom of complaint or murmur the soldiers minds appearing to be entirely occupied with the idea of being led against the enemy at bilboa it is impossible for me to do justice to the gallantry and energy of the divisions engaged this day <\s>
<s> the army are loud in expressing their desires to be led against the enemy at bilboa the universal exclamation is the bayonet <\s>
<s> lead us back to soronosa <\s>
<s> on the 10th of november the estramaduran advanced guard of about 12,000 men was defeated at burgos by a division of the french army selected for the service and having a vast superiority in cavalry and artillery <\s>
<s> this event with the same neglect of circumstances as in the former instance sir j m <\s>
<s> thus reports the french after beating the army of estramadura are advanced at burgos <\s>
<s> now surely to any unprejudiced mind the bare fact of 12,000 men chiefly raw levies having gone forward to meet and to find out the main french army under all the oppression which to the ignorant of the upper and lower classes throughout europe there is in the name of bonaparte must appear under any issue a title to the highest admiration such as would have made this slight and incidental mention of it impossible <\s>

<s> it may be objected that since sir j m <\s>
<s> no where alleges these events as proving any thing against the spaniards but simply as accounting for his own plans in which view howsoever effected whether with or without due resistance they were entitled to the same value it is unfair to say that by giving them uncircumstantially he has misrepresented them <\s>
<s> but it must be answered that in letters containing elsewhere though not immediately in connexion with these statements opinions unfavourable to the spaniards to omit any thing making for them is to misrepresent in effect <\s>

<s> postscript on sir john moore's letters <\s>
<s> whilst the latter sheets of this work were passing through the press there was laid before parliament a series of correspondence between the english government and its servants in spain amongst which were the letters of sir john moore <\s>
<s> that these letters even with minds the least vigilant to detect contradictions and to make a commentary from the past actions of the spaniards should have had power to alienate them from the spanish cause could never have been looked for except indeed by those who saw in the party spirit on this question a promise that more than ordinary pains would be taken to misrepresent their contents and to abuse the public judgment <\s>
<s> but however it was at any rate to have been expected both from the place which sir j <\s>
<s> moore held in the nation's esteem previously to his spanish campaign and also especially from that which by his death in battle he had so lately taken in its affections that they would weigh a good deal in depressing the general sympathy with spain and therefore the author of this work was desirous that all which these letters themselves or other sources of information furnished to mitigate and contradict sir j m s opinions should be laid before the public but being himself at a great distance from london and not having within his reach all the documents necessary for this purpose he has honoured the friend who corrects the press errors by making over that task to him and the reader is therefore apprised that the author is not responsible for any thing which follows <\s>
<s> those who have not examined these letters for themselves will have collected enough of their general import from conversation and the public prints to know that they pronounce an opinion unfavourable to the spaniards <\s>
<s> they will perhaps have yet to learn that this opinion is not supported by any body of facts for of facts only three are given and those as we shall see misrepresented ); but solely by the weight of sir john moore's personal authority <\s>
<s> this being the case it becomes the more important to assign the value of that authority by making such deductions from the present public estimate of it as are either fairly to be presumed from his profession and office or directly inferred from the letters under consideration <\s>
<s> as reasons for questioning ?priori the impartiality of these letters it might be suggested in reference to what they would be likely to omit first that they are the letters of a soldier that is of a man trained by the prejudices of his profession to despise or at least to rate as secondary those resources which for spain must be looked to as supreme and secondly that they are the letters of a general that is of a soldier removed by his rank from the possibility of any extensive intercourse with the lower classes concerning whom the question chiefly was <\s>
<s> but it is more important to remark in reference to what they would be likely to mis state thirdly that they are the letters of a commander in chief standing from the very day when he took the field in a dilemma which compelled him to risk the safety of his army by advancing or its honour by retreating and having to make out an apology for either issue to the very persons who had imposed this dilemma upon him the reader is requested to attend to this <\s>
<s> sir john moore found himself in león with a force which if united to quote his own words would not exceed 26,000 men <\s>
<s> such a force after the defeat of the advanced armies he was sure could effect nothing the best result he could anticipate was an inglorious retreat <\s>
<s> that he should be in this situation at the very opening of the campaign he saw would declare to all europe that somewhere there must be blame but where <\s>
<s> with himself he knew that there was none the english government with whom he must have seen that at least a part of the blame lay for sending him so late and with a force so lamentably incommensurate to the demands of the service it was not for him holding the situation that he did openly to accuse though by implication he often does accuse them ); and therefore it became his business to look to the spaniards and in their conduct to search for palliations of that inefficiency on his part which else the persons to whom he was writing would understand as charged upon themselves <\s>
<s> writing with such a purpose and under a double fettering of his faculties first from anxious forebodings of calamity or dishonour and secondly from the pain he must have felt at not being free to censure those with whom he could not but be aware that the embarrassments of his situation had at least in part originated we might expect that it would not be difficult for him to find in the early events of the campaign all which he sought and to deceive himself into a belief that in stating these events without any commentary or even hints as to the relative circumstances under which they took place which only could give to the naked facts their value and due meaning he was making no misrepresentations and doing the spaniards no injustice <\s>
<s> these suggestions are made with the greater earnestness as it is probable that the honourable death of sir john moore will have given so much more weight to his opinion on any subject as if these suggestions be warranted it is entitled on this subject to less weight than the opinion of any other individual equally intelligent and not liable from high office and perplexity of situation to the same influences of disgust or prejudice <\s>
<s> that these letters were written under some such influences is plain throughout we find in them reports of the four first events in the campaign and in justice to the spaniards it must be said that all are virtually mis statements <\s>

<s> leith of their constancy and the trials of their constancy remembering that for ten successive days they were engaged under the pressure of similar hardships with the addition of one not mentioned here viz a want of clothing in continued actions with the french here i shall take occasion to state another instance of the patience and i will add the chearfulness of the spanish soldiers under the greatest privations after the action of soronosa on the 31st ult it was deemed expedient by gen <\s>
