<s> my dear sir william from a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my letter being an utter disappointment i have not answered yours as i wished to do by return of post <\s>

<s> having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your letter let me say that though it is principally matters of science in which publication through your society would be serviceable and indeed in that department eminently so i concur with you in thinking that the same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a character to be fit for popularity <\s>

<s> my dear sir i have just received your valuable present of bentley's works for which accept my cordial thanks as also for the leaf to be added to akenside <\s>

<s> i am not unfrequently a visitor on hampstead heath and seldom pass by the entrance of mr <\s>
<s> dyson's villa on goulder's hill close by without thinking of the pleasure which akenside often had there <\s>
<s> i cannot call to mind a reason why you should not think some passages in the power of sound equal to anything i have produced <\s>
<s> when first printed in the yarrow revisited i placed it at the end of the volume and in the last edition of my poems at the close of the poems of imagination indicating thereby my own opinion of it <\s>
<s> how much do i regret that i have neither learning nor eyesight thoroughly to enjoy bentley's masterly dissertation upon the epistles of phalaris <\s>
<s> many years ago i read the work with infinite pleasure <\s>
<s> as far as i know or rather am able to judge it is without a rival in that department of literature a work of which the english nation may be proud as long as acute intellect and vigorous powers and profound scholarship shall be esteemed in the world <\s>
<s> let me again repeat my regret that in passing to and from scotland you have never found it convenient to visit this part of the country <\s>
<s> i should be delighted to see you and i am sure mr <\s>
<s> southey would be the same and in his house you would find an inexhaustible collection of books many curious no doubt but his classical library is much the least valuable part of it <\s>
<s> the death of his excellent wife was a deliverance for herself and the whole family so great had been her sufferings of mind and body <\s>

<s> my dear sir william the papers had informed me of the honour conferred upon you and i was intending to congratulate you on the occasion when your letter arrived <\s>
<s> the electors have done great credit to themselves by appointing you and not a little by rejecting the ultra liberal archbishop and that by so decided a majority <\s>

<s> as to patronage you are right in supposing that i hold it in little esteem for helping genius forward in the fine arts especially those whose medium is words <\s>
<s> sculpture and painting may be helped by it but even in those departments there is much to be dreaded <\s>
<s> the french have established an academy at rome upon an extensive scale and so far from doing good i was told by every one that it had done much harm <\s>
<s> the plan is this they select the most distinguished students from the school or academy at paris and send them to rome with handsome stipends by which they are tempted into idleness and of course into vice <\s>
<s> so that it looks like a contrivance for preventing the french nation and the world at large profiting by the genius which nature may have bestowed and which left to itself would in some cases perhaps have prospered <\s>
<s> the principal i was indeed told the only condition imposed upon these students is that each of them send annually some work of his hands to paris <\s>
<s> when at rome i saw a good deal of english artists <\s>
<s> they seemed to be living happily and doing well tho as you are aware the public patronage any of them receive is trifling <\s>
<s> genius in poetry or any department of what is called the belles lettres is much more likely to be cramped than fostered by public support better wait to reward those who have done their work tho even here national rewards are not necessary unless the labourers be if not in poverty at least in narrow circumstances <\s>
<s> let the laws be but just to them and they will be sure of attaining competence if they have not misjudged their own talents or misapplied them <\s>
<s> the cases of chatterton burns and others might it should seem be urged against the conclusion that help beforehand is not required but i do think that in the temperament of the two i have mentioned there was something which however favourable had been their circumstances however much they had been encouraged and supported would have brought on their ruin <\s>
<s> as to what patronage can do in science discoveries in physics mechanic arts c you know far better than i can pretend to do <\s>
<s> as to better canons of criticism and general improvement of scholars i really speaking without affectation am so little of a critic or scholar that it would be presumptuous in me to write upon the subject to you <\s>
<s> if we were together and you should honour me by asking my opinion upon particular points that would be a very different thing and i might have something to say not wholly without value <\s>
<s> but where could i begin with so comprehensive an argument and how could i put into the compass of a letter my thoughts such as they may be with anything like order <\s>
<s> it is somewhat mortifying to me to disappoint you <\s>
<s> you must upon reflection i trust perceive that in attempting to comply with your wish i should only lose myself in a wilderness <\s>
<s> i have been applied to to give lectures upon poetry in a public institution in london but i was conscious that i was neither competent to the office nor the public prepared to receive what i should have felt it my duty to say however inadequately <\s>
<s> i have had a very pleasant and not profitless tour on the continent tho with one great drawback the being obliged on account of the cholera to return without seeing naples and its neighbourhood <\s>

<s> my dear sir william from a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my letter being an utter disappointment i have not answered yours as i wished to do by return of post <\s>
<s> but i am really still as much at a loss how to make my letter worth reading as if i had replied immediately <\s>
<s> allow me however to thank you for your last which has completely done away with the vagueness of the former i now distinctly understand you and as to one of your leading points viz <\s>
<s> availing myself of publication through your society i may say that if there had been among my papers anything of the kind you wish for i should have gladly forwarded it to you <\s>
<s> but it is not so nor dare i undertake to promise anything of the kind for the future <\s>
<s> though prevailed upon by mr <\s>
<s> coleridge to write the first preface to my poems which tempted or rather forced me to add a supplement to it and induced by my friendship for him to write the essay upon epitaphs now appended to the excursion but first composed for the friend i have never felt inclined to write criticism though i have talked and am daily talking a great deal <\s>
<s> if i were several years younger out of friendship to you mainly i would sit down to the task of giving a body to my notions upon the essentials of poetry a subject which could not be properly treated without adverting to the other branches of fine art <\s>
<s> but at present with so much before me that i could wish to do in verse and the melancholy fact brought daily more and more home to my conviction that intellectual labour by its action on the brain and nervous system is injurious to the bodily powers and especially to my eyesight i should only be deceiving myself and misleading you were i to encourage a hope that much as i could wish to be your fellow labourer however humbly i shall ever become so <\s>
<s> having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your letter let me say that though it is principally matters of science in which publication through your society would be serviceable and indeed in that department eminently so i concur with you in thinking that the same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a character to be fit for popularity <\s>
<s> there are obviously even in criticism two ways of affecting the minds of men the one by treating the matter so as to carry it immediately to the sympathies of the many and the other by aiming at a few select and superior minds that might each become a centre for illustrating it in a popular way <\s>
<s> coleridge whom you allude to acted upon the world to a great extent thro the latter of these processes and there cannot be a doubt that your society might serve the cause of just thinking and pure taste should you as president of it hold up to view the desirableness of first conveying to a few thro that channel reflections upon literature and art which if well meditated would be sure of winning their way directly or in their indirect results to a gradually widening circle <\s>
<s> may i not encourage a hope that during the ensuing summer or at the worst at no distant period you and i might meet when a few hours conversation would effect more than could come out of a dozen letters dictated and hastily as i am obliged to dictate this from an unexpected interruption when mrs <\s>
<s> and i were sitting down with the pen in her hand <\s>
<s> you are right in your recollection that i named to you the subject of foreign piracy as injurious to english authors and i may add now that if it could be put a stop to i believe that it would rarely happen that successful writers on works of imagination and feeling at least would stand in need of pensions from government or would feel themselves justified in accepting them <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have spoken a great deal to m p s of all parties and with several distinguished americans <\s>
<s> i have also been in correspondence with the present chancellor of the exchequer upon it and dwelt upon the same topic in a letter which i had occasion to write to sir robert peel <\s>
<s> lytton bulwer as perhaps you know drew the attention of parliament to it during the late session <\s>
<s> lord palmerston said in answer to him that the attention of government had already been directed to the measure and that it would not be lost sight of or something to that purpose <\s>
<s> i may claim some credit for my exertions in this business and full as much or more for the pains which i have taken for many years to interest men in the h ouse of c ommons in the extension of the term of copyright a measure which i trust is about to be brought to a successful close by the exertions of my admirable friend serjeant talfourd <\s>
<s> to him i have written upon the argument more than once <\s>
<s> when this is effected i trust the other part of the subject will be taken up with spirit and if the foreign secretary in whose department the matter lies should be remiss i trust he will be stimulated thro parliament to which desirable end the services of distinguished societies like yours and the notice of the question by men of letters in reviews or otherwise would greatly contribute <\s>
<s> good authors if justice were done to them by their own and foreign countries now that reading is spread and spreading so widely would very few of them be in need except thro their own fault <\s>
<s> when i was in town last august the american minister mr <\s>

<s> my dear sir william from a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my letter being an utter disappointment i have not answered yours as i wished to do by return of post <\s>

<s> having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your letter let me say that though it is principally matters of science in which publication through your society would be serviceable and indeed in that department eminently so i concur with you in thinking that the same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a character to be fit for popularity <\s>

<s> my dear sir i have just received your valuable present of bentley's works for which accept my cordial thanks as also for the leaf to be added to akenside <\s>

<s> i am not unfrequently a visitor on hampstead heath and seldom pass by the entrance of mr <\s>
<s> dyson's villa on goulder's hill close by without thinking of the pleasure which akenside often had there <\s>
<s> i cannot call to mind a reason why you should not think some passages in the power of sound equal to anything i have produced <\s>
<s> when first printed in the yarrow revisited i placed it at the end of the volume and in the last edition of my poems at the close of the poems of imagination indicating thereby my own opinion of it <\s>
<s> how much do i regret that i have neither learning nor eyesight thoroughly to enjoy bentley's masterly dissertation upon the epistles of phalaris <\s>
<s> many years ago i read the work with infinite pleasure <\s>
<s> as far as i know or rather am able to judge it is without a rival in that department of literature a work of which the english nation may be proud as long as acute intellect and vigorous powers and profound scholarship shall be esteemed in the world <\s>
<s> let me again repeat my regret that in passing to and from scotland you have never found it convenient to visit this part of the country <\s>
<s> i should be delighted to see you and i am sure mr <\s>
<s> southey would be the same and in his house you would find an inexhaustible collection of books many curious no doubt but his classical library is much the least valuable part of it <\s>
<s> the death of his excellent wife was a deliverance for herself and the whole family so great had been her sufferings of mind and body <\s>

<s> my dear sir william the papers had informed me of the honour conferred upon you and i was intending to congratulate you on the occasion when your letter arrived <\s>
<s> the electors have done great credit to themselves by appointing you and not a little by rejecting the ultra liberal archbishop and that by so decided a majority <\s>

<s> as to patronage you are right in supposing that i hold it in little esteem for helping genius forward in the fine arts especially those whose medium is words <\s>
<s> sculpture and painting may be helped by it but even in those departments there is much to be dreaded <\s>
<s> the french have established an academy at rome upon an extensive scale and so far from doing good i was told by every one that it had done much harm <\s>
<s> the plan is this they select the most distinguished students from the school or academy at paris and send them to rome with handsome stipends by which they are tempted into idleness and of course into vice <\s>
<s> so that it looks like a contrivance for preventing the french nation and the world at large profiting by the genius which nature may have bestowed and which left to itself would in some cases perhaps have prospered <\s>
<s> the principal i was indeed told the only condition imposed upon these students is that each of them send annually some work of his hands to paris <\s>
<s> when at rome i saw a good deal of english artists <\s>
<s> they seemed to be living happily and doing well tho as you are aware the public patronage any of them receive is trifling <\s>
<s> genius in poetry or any department of what is called the belles lettres is much more likely to be cramped than fostered by public support better wait to reward those who have done their work tho even here national rewards are not necessary unless the labourers be if not in poverty at least in narrow circumstances <\s>
<s> let the laws be but just to them and they will be sure of attaining competence if they have not misjudged their own talents or misapplied them <\s>
<s> the cases of chatterton burns and others might it should seem be urged against the conclusion that help beforehand is not required but i do think that in the temperament of the two i have mentioned there was something which however favourable had been their circumstances however much they had been encouraged and supported would have brought on their ruin <\s>
<s> as to what patronage can do in science discoveries in physics mechanic arts c you know far better than i can pretend to do <\s>
<s> as to better canons of criticism and general improvement of scholars i really speaking without affectation am so little of a critic or scholar that it would be presumptuous in me to write upon the subject to you <\s>
<s> if we were together and you should honour me by asking my opinion upon particular points that would be a very different thing and i might have something to say not wholly without value <\s>
<s> but where could i begin with so comprehensive an argument and how could i put into the compass of a letter my thoughts such as they may be with anything like order <\s>
<s> it is somewhat mortifying to me to disappoint you <\s>
<s> you must upon reflection i trust perceive that in attempting to comply with your wish i should only lose myself in a wilderness <\s>
<s> i have been applied to to give lectures upon poetry in a public institution in london but i was conscious that i was neither competent to the office nor the public prepared to receive what i should have felt it my duty to say however inadequately <\s>
<s> i have had a very pleasant and not profitless tour on the continent tho with one great drawback the being obliged on account of the cholera to return without seeing naples and its neighbourhood <\s>

<s> my dear sir william from a hope of something starting up in my mind which might prevent my letter being an utter disappointment i have not answered yours as i wished to do by return of post <\s>
<s> but i am really still as much at a loss how to make my letter worth reading as if i had replied immediately <\s>
<s> allow me however to thank you for your last which has completely done away with the vagueness of the former i now distinctly understand you and as to one of your leading points viz <\s>
<s> availing myself of publication through your society i may say that if there had been among my papers anything of the kind you wish for i should have gladly forwarded it to you <\s>
<s> but it is not so nor dare i undertake to promise anything of the kind for the future <\s>
<s> though prevailed upon by mr <\s>
<s> coleridge to write the first preface to my poems which tempted or rather forced me to add a supplement to it and induced by my friendship for him to write the essay upon epitaphs now appended to the excursion but first composed for the friend i have never felt inclined to write criticism though i have talked and am daily talking a great deal <\s>
<s> if i were several years younger out of friendship to you mainly i would sit down to the task of giving a body to my notions upon the essentials of poetry a subject which could not be properly treated without adverting to the other branches of fine art <\s>
<s> but at present with so much before me that i could wish to do in verse and the melancholy fact brought daily more and more home to my conviction that intellectual labour by its action on the brain and nervous system is injurious to the bodily powers and especially to my eyesight i should only be deceiving myself and misleading you were i to encourage a hope that much as i could wish to be your fellow labourer however humbly i shall ever become so <\s>
<s> having disposed of this rather painful part of the subject of your letter let me say that though it is principally matters of science in which publication through your society would be serviceable and indeed in that department eminently so i concur with you in thinking that the same vehicle would be useful for bringing under the notice of the thinking part of the community critical essays of too abstract a character to be fit for popularity <\s>
<s> there are obviously even in criticism two ways of affecting the minds of men the one by treating the matter so as to carry it immediately to the sympathies of the many and the other by aiming at a few select and superior minds that might each become a centre for illustrating it in a popular way <\s>
<s> coleridge whom you allude to acted upon the world to a great extent thro the latter of these processes and there cannot be a doubt that your society might serve the cause of just thinking and pure taste should you as president of it hold up to view the desirableness of first conveying to a few thro that channel reflections upon literature and art which if well meditated would be sure of winning their way directly or in their indirect results to a gradually widening circle <\s>
<s> may i not encourage a hope that during the ensuing summer or at the worst at no distant period you and i might meet when a few hours conversation would effect more than could come out of a dozen letters dictated and hastily as i am obliged to dictate this from an unexpected interruption when mrs <\s>
<s> and i were sitting down with the pen in her hand <\s>
<s> you are right in your recollection that i named to you the subject of foreign piracy as injurious to english authors and i may add now that if it could be put a stop to i believe that it would rarely happen that successful writers on works of imagination and feeling at least would stand in need of pensions from government or would feel themselves justified in accepting them <\s>
<s> upon this subject i have spoken a great deal to m p s of all parties and with several distinguished americans <\s>
<s> i have also been in correspondence with the present chancellor of the exchequer upon it and dwelt upon the same topic in a letter which i had occasion to write to sir robert peel <\s>
<s> lytton bulwer as perhaps you know drew the attention of parliament to it during the late session <\s>
<s> lord palmerston said in answer to him that the attention of government had already been directed to the measure and that it would not be lost sight of or something to that purpose <\s>
<s> i may claim some credit for my exertions in this business and full as much or more for the pains which i have taken for many years to interest men in the h ouse of c ommons in the extension of the term of copyright a measure which i trust is about to be brought to a successful close by the exertions of my admirable friend serjeant talfourd <\s>
<s> to him i have written upon the argument more than once <\s>
<s> when this is effected i trust the other part of the subject will be taken up with spirit and if the foreign secretary in whose department the matter lies should be remiss i trust he will be stimulated thro parliament to which desirable end the services of distinguished societies like yours and the notice of the question by men of letters in reviews or otherwise would greatly contribute <\s>
<s> good authors if justice were done to them by their own and foreign countries now that reading is spread and spreading so widely would very few of them be in need except thro their own fault <\s>
<s> when i was in town last august the american minister mr <\s>
