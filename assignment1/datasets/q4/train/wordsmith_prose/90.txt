<s> my dear sister has been languishing more than seven months in a sick room nor dare i or any of her friends entertain a hope that her strength will ever be restored and the course of public affairs as i think i told you before threatens in my view destruction to the institutions of the country an event which whatever may rise out of it hereafter cannot but produce distress and misery for two or three generations at least <\s>
<s> in any times i am but at best a poor and unpunctual correspondent yet i am pretty sure you would have heard from me but for this reason therefore let the statement pass for an apology as far as you think fit <\s>
<s> the verses called forth by your love and the disappointment that followed i have read with much pleasure tho grieved that you should have suffered so much as poetry they derive an interest from your philosophical pursuits which could not but recommend the verses even to indifferent readers and must give them in the eyes of your friends a great charm <\s>
<s> the style appears to me good and the general flow of the versification harmonious but you deal somewhat more in dactylic endings and identical terminations than i am accustomed to think legitimate <\s>
<s> sincerely do i congratulate you upon being able to continue your philosophical pursuits under such a pressure of personal feeling <\s>
<s> it gives me much pleasure that you and coleridge have met and that you were not disappointed in the conversation of a man from whose writings you had previously drawn so much delight and improvement <\s>
