<s> in reference to this poem i will here mention one of the most remarkable facts in my own poetic history and that of mr <\s>
<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>
<s> we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections <\s>
<s> we returned by dulverton to alfoxden <\s>
<s> the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium <\s>
<s> accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others <\s>
<s> to return to we are seven the piece that called forth this note i composed it while walking in the grove of alfoxden <\s>
<s> my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having begun with the last line <\s>
<s> when it was all but finished i came in and recited it to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge and my sister and said a prefatory stanza must be added and i should sit down to our little tea meal with greater pleasure if my task was finished <\s>
<s> i mentioned in substance what i wished to be expressed and coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus a little child dear brother jem <\s>
<s> i objected to the rhyme dear brother jem as being ludicrous but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend james tobin's name who was familiarly called jem <\s>
<s> he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice <\s>
<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>
<s> one evening he came to me with a grave face and said wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about to publish <\s>
<s> there is one poem in it which i earnestly entreat you will cancel for if published it will make you everlastingly ridiculous <\s>
<s> i answered that i felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to <\s>

<s> i will only add a little monitory anecdote concerning this subject <\s>
<s> when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem <\s>
<s> just as the words had past his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats <\s>
<s> i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are and with far less sagacity give way to presumptuous criticism from which he was free though in this matter mistaken <\s>

<s> barbauld as unnatural and absurd <\s>

<s> barbauld and am certain that had her education been favourable to imaginative influences no female of her day would have been more likely to sympathise with that image and to acknowledge the truth of the sentiment <\s>

<s> xii this was suggested in front of alfoxden <\s>
<s> the boy was a son of my friend basil montagu who had been two or three years under our care <\s>
<s> the name of kilve is from a village in the bristol channel about a mile from alfoxden and the name of liswin farm was taken from a beautiful spot on the wye <\s>
<s> coleridge my sister and i had been visiting the famous john thelwall who had taken refuge from politics after a trial for high treason with a view to bring up his family by the profits of agriculture which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had fled from <\s>
<s> coleridge and he had been public lecturers coleridge mingling with his politics theology from which the other abstained unless it were for the sake of a sneer <\s>
<s> this quondam community of public employment induced thelwall to visit coleridge at nether stowey where he fell in my way <\s>
<s> he really was a man of extraordinary talent an affectionate husband and a good father <\s>
<s> though brought up in the city on a tailor's board he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects <\s>
<s> i remember once when coleridge he and i were seated together upon the turf on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of alfoxden coleridge exclaimed this is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world <\s>
<s> nay said thelwall to make one forget them altogether <\s>
<s> the visit of this man to coleridge was as i believe coleridge has related the occasion of a spy being sent by government to watch our proceedings which were i can say with truth such as the world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless <\s>

<s> barbara lewthwaite now living at ambleside 1843 though much changed as to beauty was one of two most lovely sisters <\s>
<s> almost the first words my poor brother john said when he visited us for the first time at grasmere were were those two angels that i have just seen <\s>
<s> and from his description i have no doubt they were those two sisters <\s>
<s> the mother died in childbed and one of our neighbours at grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her dead babe in her arm <\s>
<s> i mention this to notice what i cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed which was never done nor i believe is now till a minute or two before the corpse was removed <\s>
<s> barbara lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom i had seen and overheard as engaged in the poem <\s>
<s> i chose the name for reasons implied in the above and will here add a caution against the use of names of living persons <\s>
<s> within a few months after the publication of this poem i was much surprised and more hurt to find it in a child's school book which having been compiled by lindley murray had come into use at grasmere school where barbara was a pupil <\s>

<s> xviii the subject of this poem was sent me by mrs <\s>
<s> ogle to whom i was personally unknown with a hope on her part that i might be induced to relate the incident in verse <\s>
<s> and i do not regret that i took the trouble for not improbably the fact is illustrative of the boy's early piety and may concur with my other little pieces on children to produce profitable reflection among my youthful readers <\s>
<s> this is said however with an absolute conviction that children will derive most benefit from books which are not unworthy the perusal of persons of any age <\s>
<s> i protest with my whole heart against those productions so abundant in the present day in which the doings of children are dwelt upon as if they were incapable of being interested in anything else <\s>
<s> on this subject i have dwelt at length in the poem on the growth of my own mind <\s>
<s> poems founded on the affections <\s>
<s> this poem was composed in a grove at the north eastern end of grasmere lake which grove was in a great measure destroyed by turning the high road along the side of the water <\s>
<s> the few trees that are left were spared at my intercession <\s>
<s> the poem arose out of the fact mentioned to me at ennerdale that a shepherd had fallen asleep upon the top of the rock called the pillar and perished as here described his staff being left midway on the rock <\s>
<s> foot note from the great gavel down by leeza's banks l <\s>
<s> the great gavel so called i imagine from its resemblance to the gable end of a house is one of the highest of the cumberland mountains <\s>

<s> this was written in the year 1815 as a token of affectionate respect for the memory of milton <\s>

<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>
<s> we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections <\s>
<s> we returned by dulverton to alfoxden <\s>
<s> the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium <\s>
<s> accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others <\s>
<s> to return to we are seven the piece that called forth this note i composed it while walking in the grove of alfoxden <\s>
<s> my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having begun with the last line <\s>
<s> when it was all but finished i came in and recited it to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge and my sister and said a prefatory stanza must be added and i should sit down to our little tea meal with greater pleasure if my task was finished <\s>
<s> i mentioned in substance what i wished to be expressed and coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus a little child dear brother jem <\s>
<s> i objected to the rhyme dear brother jem as being ludicrous but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend james tobin's name who was familiarly called jem <\s>
<s> he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice <\s>
<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>
<s> one evening he came to me with a grave face and said wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about to publish <\s>
<s> there is one poem in it which i earnestly entreat you will cancel for if published it will make you everlastingly ridiculous <\s>
<s> i answered that i felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to <\s>

<s> i have only to add that in the spring of 1841 i visited goodrich castle not having seen that part of the wye since i met the little girl there in 1793 <\s>

<s> just as the words had past his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats <\s>

<s> the mother died in childbed and one of our neighbours at grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her dead babe in her arm <\s>
<s> i mention this to notice what i cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed which was never done nor i believe is now till a minute or two before the corpse was removed <\s>

<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>
<s> we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections <\s>
<s> we returned by dulverton to alfoxden <\s>
<s> the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium <\s>
<s> accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others <\s>

<s> he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice <\s>
<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>

<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>
<s> we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections <\s>
<s> we returned by dulverton to alfoxden <\s>
<s> the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium <\s>
<s> accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others <\s>
<s> to return to we are seven the piece that called forth this note i composed it while walking in the grove of alfoxden <\s>
<s> my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having begun with the last line <\s>
<s> when it was all but finished i came in and recited it to mr <\s>

<s> he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice <\s>
<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>
<s> one evening he came to me with a grave face and said wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about to publish <\s>

<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>

<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>

<s> when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem <\s>
<s> just as the words had past his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats <\s>
<s> i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are and with far less sagacity give way to presumptuous criticism from which he was free though in this matter mistaken <\s>

<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>

<s> in reference to this poem i will here mention one of the most remarkable facts in my own poetic history and that of mr <\s>
<s> in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit linton and the valley of stones near to it and as our united funds were very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by phillips the bookseller and edited by dr <\s>
<s> accordingly we set off and proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on a dream as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge said of his friend mr <\s>
<s> much the greatest part of the story was mr <\s>
<s> coleridge's invention but certain parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed which would bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of that crime and his own wanderings <\s>
<s> i had been reading in shelvocke's voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of sea fowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet <\s>
<s> suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime <\s>
<s> the incident was thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly <\s>
<s> i also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem <\s>
<s> the gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have no doubt it was a gratuitous after thought <\s>
<s> we began the composition together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem in particular and listen'd like a three years child the mariner had his will <\s>
<s> these trifling contributions all but one which mr <\s>
<s> has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as they well might <\s>
<s> as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog <\s>
<s> we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections <\s>
<s> we returned by dulverton to alfoxden <\s>
<s> the ancient mariner grew and grew till it became too important for our first object which was limited to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist as mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has told the world of poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as much as might be through an imaginative medium <\s>
<s> accordingly i wrote the idiot boy her eyes are wild c and we are seven the thorn and some others <\s>
<s> to return to we are seven the piece that called forth this note i composed it while walking in the grove of alfoxden <\s>
<s> my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having begun with the last line <\s>
<s> when it was all but finished i came in and recited it to mr <\s>
<s> coleridge and my sister and said a prefatory stanza must be added and i should sit down to our little tea meal with greater pleasure if my task was finished <\s>
<s> i mentioned in substance what i wished to be expressed and coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus a little child dear brother jem <\s>
<s> i objected to the rhyme dear brother jem as being ludicrous but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend james tobin's name who was familiarly called jem <\s>
<s> he was the brother of the dramatist and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice <\s>
<s> the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing in that city <\s>
<s> one evening he came to me with a grave face and said wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about to publish <\s>
<s> there is one poem in it which i earnestly entreat you will cancel for if published it will make you everlastingly ridiculous <\s>
<s> i answered that i felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to <\s>
<s> he said it is called we are seven nay said i that shall take its chance however and he left me in despair <\s>
<s> i have only to add that in the spring of 1841 i visited goodrich castle not having seen that part of the wye since i met the little girl there in 1793 <\s>
<s> it would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much but that was impossible as unfortunately i did not even know her name <\s>
<s> the ruin from its position and features is a most impressive object <\s>
<s> i could not but deeply regret that its solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new castle set up on a projection of the same ridge as if to show how far modern art can go in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with their united graces remembrances and associations <\s>

<s> the idle shepherd boys or dungeon ghyll force a pastoral <\s>
<s> xi grasmere town end 1800 <\s>
<s> i will only add a little monitory anecdote concerning this subject <\s>
<s> when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherd boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem <\s>
<s> just as the words had past his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats <\s>
<s> i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are and with far less sagacity give way to presumptuous criticism from which he was free though in this matter mistaken <\s>
<s> in describing a tarn under helvellyn i say there sometimes doth a leaping fish send through the tarn a lonely cheer <\s>
<s> this was branded by a critic of those days in a review ascribed to mrs <\s>
<s> barbauld as unnatural and absurd <\s>
<s> i admire the genius of mrs <\s>
<s> barbauld and am certain that had her education been favourable to imaginative influences no female of her day would have been more likely to sympathise with that image and to acknowledge the truth of the sentiment <\s>

<s> coleridge and he had been public lecturers coleridge mingling with his politics theology from which the other abstained unless it were for the sake of a sneer <\s>
<s> this quondam community of public employment induced thelwall to visit coleridge at nether stowey where he fell in my way <\s>
<s> he really was a man of extraordinary talent an affectionate husband and a good father <\s>
<s> though brought up in the city on a tailor's board he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects <\s>
<s> i remember once when coleridge he and i were seated together upon the turf on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of alfoxden coleridge exclaimed this is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world <\s>
<s> nay said thelwall to make one forget them altogether <\s>
<s> the visit of this man to coleridge was as i believe coleridge has related the occasion of a spy being sent by government to watch our proceedings which were i can say with truth such as the world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless <\s>

<s> almost the first words my poor brother john said when he visited us for the first time at grasmere were were those two angels that i have just seen <\s>
<s> and from his description i have no doubt they were those two sisters <\s>
<s> the mother died in childbed and one of our neighbours at grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her dead babe in her arm <\s>
<s> i mention this to notice what i cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed which was never done nor i believe is now till a minute or two before the corpse was removed <\s>
<s> barbara lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom i had seen and overheard as engaged in the poem <\s>
<s> i chose the name for reasons implied in the above and will here add a caution against the use of names of living persons <\s>
<s> within a few months after the publication of this poem i was much surprised and more hurt to find it in a child's school book which having been compiled by lindley murray had come into use at grasmere school where barbara was a pupil <\s>
