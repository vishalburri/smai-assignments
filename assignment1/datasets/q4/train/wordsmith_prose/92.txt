<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>
<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> my dear sir upon returning from a tour of several months upon the continent i find two letters from you awaiting my arrival along with the edition of my poems you have done me the honour of editing <\s>
<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>
<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>

<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>
<s> having many letters to write on returning to england after so long an absence i regret that i must be so brief on the present occasion <\s>
<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>
<s> let us hope that our authors of true genius will not be unconscious of that thought or inattentive to the duty which it imposes upon them of doing their utmost to instruct to purify and to elevate their readers <\s>

<s> quillinan we are heartily glad to learn from your letter just received that in all probability by this time you must have left the unhappy country in which you have been so long residing <\s>
<s> i should not have been sorry if you had entered a little more into peninsular politics for what is going on there is shocking to humanity and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles <\s>
<s> the position of the miguelites relatively to the conflicting so called liberal parties is just what i apprehended and expressed very lately to mr <\s>
<s> he came down with us to hereford with a view to a short tour on the banks of the wye which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my old complaint of inflammation in the eye and in consequence of this dora will accompany me home with a promise on her part of returning to london before the month of october is out <\s>
<s> our places are taken in to morrow's coach for liverpool so that since we must be disappointed of seeing you and jemima here we trust that you will come on to rydal from leeds <\s>
<s> this very day dora had read to me your poem again it convinces me along with your other writings that it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of england <\s>
<s> your thoughts feelings knowledge and judgment in style and skill in metre entitle you to it and if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen <\s>
<s> it is worthy of note how much of gray's popularity is owing to the happiness with which his subject is selected in three places his hymn to adversity his ode on the distant prospect of eton college and his elegy <\s>
<s> i ought however in justice to you to add that one cause of your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself so that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you for the best subjects or to employ as much time in reflecting condensing bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the best point of view as is necessary <\s>
<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>
<s> you know my principles of style better i think than any one else and i should be glad to learn if anything strikes you as being altered for the worse <\s>
<s> you will find the principal changes are in the white doe in which i had too little of the benefit of your help and judgment <\s>

<s> i should not have been sorry if you had entered a little more into peninsular politics for what is going on there is shocking to humanity and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles <\s>
<s> the position of the miguelites relatively to the conflicting so called liberal parties is just what i apprehended and expressed very lately to mr <\s>
<s> he came down with us to hereford with a view to a short tour on the banks of the wye which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my old complaint of inflammation in the eye and in consequence of this dora will accompany me home with a promise on her part of returning to london before the month of october is out <\s>
<s> our places are taken in to morrow's coach for liverpool so that since we must be disappointed of seeing you and jemima here we trust that you will come on to rydal from leeds <\s>
<s> this very day dora had read to me your poem again it convinces me along with your other writings that it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of england <\s>
<s> your thoughts feelings knowledge and judgment in style and skill in metre entitle you to it and if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen <\s>
<s> it is worthy of note how much of gray's popularity is owing to the happiness with which his subject is selected in three places his hymn to adversity his ode on the distant prospect of eton college and his elegy <\s>
<s> i ought however in justice to you to add that one cause of your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself so that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you for the best subjects or to employ as much time in reflecting condensing bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the best point of view as is necessary <\s>
<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>
<s> you know my principles of style better i think than any one else and i should be glad to learn if anything strikes you as being altered for the worse <\s>
<s> you will find the principal changes are in the white doe in which i had too little of the benefit of your help and judgment <\s>
<s> there are several also in the sonnets both miscellaneous and political in the other poems they are nothing like so numerous but here also i should be glad if you would take the like trouble <\s>
<s> jemima i am sure will be pleased to assist you in the comparison by reading new or old as you may think fit <\s>

<s> in the question of the patronage as between the bishop and the people i entirely concur with you in preference of the former <\s>
<s> such is now the force of public opinion that bishops are not likely to present upon merely selfish considerations and if the judgment of one be not good that of his successor may make amends and probably will <\s>
<s> but elections of this sort when vested in the inhabitants have as far as my experience goes given rise to so many cabals and manoeuvres and caused such enmities and heart burnings that christian charity has been driven out of sight by them and how often and how soon have the successful party been seen to repent of their own choice <\s>
<s> the course of public affairs being what it is in respect to the church i cannot reconcile myself to delay from a hope of succeeding at another time <\s>
<s> if we can get a new church erected at cockermouth great will be the benefit with the blessing of god to that place and our success cannot i trust but excite some neighbouring places to follow the example <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>

<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>

<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>

<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>
<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> my dear sir upon returning from a tour of several months upon the continent i find two letters from you awaiting my arrival along with the edition of my poems you have done me the honour of editing <\s>
<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>
<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>

<s> it must surely be gratifying to one whose aim as an author has been the hearts of his fellow creatures of all ranks and in all stations to find that he has succeeded in any quarter and still more must he be gratified to learn that he has pleased in a distant country men of simple habits and cultivated taste who are at the same time widely acquainted with literature <\s>
<s> your second letter accompanying the edition of the poems i have read but unluckily have it not before me <\s>
<s> it was lent to serjeant talfourd on account of the passage in it that alludes to the possible and desirable establishment of english copyright in america <\s>
<s> i shall now hasten to notice the edition which you have superintended of my poems <\s>
<s> this i can do with much pleasure as the book which has been shown to several persons of taste mr <\s>
<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>
<s> having many letters to write on returning to england after so long an absence i regret that i must be so brief on the present occasion <\s>
<s> i cannot conclude however without assuring you that the acknowledgments which i receive from the vast continent of america are among the most grateful that reach me <\s>
<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>
<s> let us hope that our authors of true genius will not be unconscious of that thought or inattentive to the duty which it imposes upon them of doing their utmost to instruct to purify and to elevate their readers <\s>

<s> quillinan we are heartily glad to learn from your letter just received that in all probability by this time you must have left the unhappy country in which you have been so long residing <\s>
<s> i should not have been sorry if you had entered a little more into peninsular politics for what is going on there is shocking to humanity and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles <\s>
<s> the position of the miguelites relatively to the conflicting so called liberal parties is just what i apprehended and expressed very lately to mr <\s>
<s> he came down with us to hereford with a view to a short tour on the banks of the wye which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my old complaint of inflammation in the eye and in consequence of this dora will accompany me home with a promise on her part of returning to london before the month of october is out <\s>
<s> our places are taken in to morrow's coach for liverpool so that since we must be disappointed of seeing you and jemima here we trust that you will come on to rydal from leeds <\s>
<s> this very day dora had read to me your poem again it convinces me along with your other writings that it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of england <\s>
<s> your thoughts feelings knowledge and judgment in style and skill in metre entitle you to it and if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen <\s>
<s> it is worthy of note how much of gray's popularity is owing to the happiness with which his subject is selected in three places his hymn to adversity his ode on the distant prospect of eton college and his elegy <\s>
<s> i ought however in justice to you to add that one cause of your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself so that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you for the best subjects or to employ as much time in reflecting condensing bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the best point of view as is necessary <\s>
<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>
<s> you know my principles of style better i think than any one else and i should be glad to learn if anything strikes you as being altered for the worse <\s>
<s> you will find the principal changes are in the white doe in which i had too little of the benefit of your help and judgment <\s>

<s> i should not have been sorry if you had entered a little more into peninsular politics for what is going on there is shocking to humanity and one would be glad to see anything like an opening for the termination of these unnatural troubles <\s>
<s> the position of the miguelites relatively to the conflicting so called liberal parties is just what i apprehended and expressed very lately to mr <\s>
<s> he came down with us to hereford with a view to a short tour on the banks of the wye which has been prevented by an unexpected attack of my old complaint of inflammation in the eye and in consequence of this dora will accompany me home with a promise on her part of returning to london before the month of october is out <\s>
<s> our places are taken in to morrow's coach for liverpool so that since we must be disappointed of seeing you and jemima here we trust that you will come on to rydal from leeds <\s>
<s> this very day dora had read to me your poem again it convinces me along with your other writings that it is in your power to attain a permanent place among the poets of england <\s>
<s> your thoughts feelings knowledge and judgment in style and skill in metre entitle you to it and if you have not yet succeeded in gaining it the cause appears to me merely to lie in the subjects which you have chosen <\s>
<s> it is worthy of note how much of gray's popularity is owing to the happiness with which his subject is selected in three places his hymn to adversity his ode on the distant prospect of eton college and his elegy <\s>
<s> i ought however in justice to you to add that one cause of your failure appears to have been thinking too humbly of yourself so that you have not reckoned it worth while to look sufficiently round you for the best subjects or to employ as much time in reflecting condensing bringing out and placing your thoughts and feelings in the best point of view as is necessary <\s>
<s> i will conclude this matter of poetry and my part of the letter with requesting that as an act of friendship at your convenience you would take the trouble a considerable one i own of comparing the corrections in my last edition with the text in the preceding one <\s>
<s> you know my principles of style better i think than any one else and i should be glad to learn if anything strikes you as being altered for the worse <\s>
<s> you will find the principal changes are in the white doe in which i had too little of the benefit of your help and judgment <\s>
<s> there are several also in the sonnets both miscellaneous and political in the other poems they are nothing like so numerous but here also i should be glad if you would take the like trouble <\s>
<s> jemima i am sure will be pleased to assist you in the comparison by reading new or old as you may think fit <\s>

<s> in the question of the patronage as between the bishop and the people i entirely concur with you in preference of the former <\s>
<s> such is now the force of public opinion that bishops are not likely to present upon merely selfish considerations and if the judgment of one be not good that of his successor may make amends and probably will <\s>
<s> but elections of this sort when vested in the inhabitants have as far as my experience goes given rise to so many cabals and manoeuvres and caused such enmities and heart burnings that christian charity has been driven out of sight by them and how often and how soon have the successful party been seen to repent of their own choice <\s>
<s> the course of public affairs being what it is in respect to the church i cannot reconcile myself to delay from a hope of succeeding at another time <\s>
<s> if we can get a new church erected at cockermouth great will be the benefit with the blessing of god to that place and our success cannot i trust but excite some neighbouring places to follow the example <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>

<s> rogers in particular is allowed to be far the handsomest specimen of printing in double columns which they have seen <\s>
<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>
<s> it may be allowed me also to express a hope that such a law will be passed ere long by the american legislature as will place english authors in general upon a better footing in america than at present they have obtained and that the protection of copyright between the two countries will be reciprocal <\s>
<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>
<s> besides justice is the foundation on which both law and practice ought to rest <\s>

<s> what a vast field is there open to the english mind acting through our noble language <\s>

<s> to begin with the former letter april 25 1836 it gives me concern that you should have thought it necessary not to apologise for that you have not done but to explain at length why you addressed me in the language of affectionate regard <\s>

<s> allow me to thank you for the pains you have bestowed upon the work <\s>
<s> do not apprehend that any difference in our several arrangements of the poems can be of much importance you appear to understand me far too well for that to be possible <\s>
<s> i have only to regret in respect to this volume that it should have been published before my last edition in the correction of which i took great pains as my last labour in that way and which moreover contains several additional pieces <\s>

<s> the vast circulation of english works in america offers a temptation for hasty and incorrect printing and that same vast circulation would without adding to the price of each copy of an english work in a degree that could be grudged or thought injurious by any purchaser allow an american remuneration which might add considerably to the comforts of english authors who may be in narrow circumstances yet who at the same time may have written solely from honourable motives <\s>

<s> graves and i was under a promise to let him know if any vacancy occurred in the neighbourhood and to do all i could without infringing upon prior or stronger claims to promote the attainment of his wishes <\s>
<s> the mind of every thinking man who is attached to the church of england must at this time be especially turned to reflections upon all points of ecclesiastical polity government and management which may tend to strengthen the establishment in the affections of the people and enlarge the sphere of its efficiency <\s>
<s> it cannot then i feel be impertinent in me though a layman to express upon this occasion my satisfaction qualified as it is by what has been said above in finding from this instance that our diocesan is unwilling to station clergymen in cures with which they are locally connected <\s>
<s> some years ago when the present bishop of london then of chester was residing in this neighbourhood i took the liberty of strenuously recommending to him not to ordain young men to curacies where they had been brought up or in the midst of their own relatives <\s>
<s> i had seen too much of the mischief of this especially as affecting the functions and characters of ministers born and bred up in the lower classes of society <\s>
<s> it has been painful to me to observe the false position as the french would call it in which men so placed are <\s>
<s> their habits their manners and their talk their acquaintanceships their friendships and let me say their domestic affections naturally and properly draw them one way while their professional obligations point out another and accordingly if they are sensible of both they live in a perpetual conflict and are liable to be taxed with pride and ingratitude as seeming to neglect their old friends when they only associate with them with that reserve and under those restraints which their sacred profession enjoins <\s>
<s> if on the other hand they fall into unrestrained familiarity with the associates of their earlier life and boyish days how injurious to their ministry such intercourse would be must flash upon every man's mind whose thoughts have turned for a moment to the subject <\s>

<s> had the individuals who signed those documents been fitly impressed with the awfullness of the act they were about to engage in they could not have undertaken it .... <\s>
<s> would it not be a good plan for bishops to exclude testimonials from relatives and near connections <\s>
<s> it is painful to notice what a tendency there is in men's minds to allow even a slight call of private regard to outweigh a very strong claim of duty to the public and not less in sacred concerns than in civil <\s>
