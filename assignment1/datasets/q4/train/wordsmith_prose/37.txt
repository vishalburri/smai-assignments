<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> it may still be asked where lies the particular relation of what has been said to these volumes the question will be easily answered by the discerning reader who is old enough to remember the taste that prevailed when some of these poems were first published seventeen years ago who has also observed to what degree the poetry of this island has since that period been coloured by them and who is further aware of the unremitting hostility with which upon some principle or other they have each and all been opposed <\s>
<s> a sketch of my own notion of the constitution of fame has been given and as far as concerns myself i have cause to be satisfied <\s>
<s> the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which these poems have been received knowing as i do the source within my own mind from which they have proceeded and the labour and pains which when labour and pains appeared needful have been bestowed upon them must all if i think consistently be received as pledges and tokens bearing the same general impression though widely different in value they are all proofs that for the present time i have not laboured in vain and afford assurances more or less authentic that the products of my industry will endure <\s>
<s> if there be one conclusion more forcibly pressed upon us than another by the review which has been given of the fortunes and fate of poetical works it is this that every author as far as he is great and at the same time original has had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed so has it been so will it continue to be <\s>
<s> this remark was long since made to me by the philosophical friend for the separation of whose poems from my own i have previously expressed my regret <\s>

<s> and where lies the real difficulty of creating that taste by which a truly original poet is to be relished <\s>
<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>

<s> is it in breaking the bonds of custom in overcoming the prejudices of false refinement and displacing the aversions of inexperience <\s>
<s> or if he labour for an object which here and elsewhere i have proposed to myself does it consist in divesting the reader of the pride that induces him to dwell upon those points wherein men differ from each other to the exclusion of those in which all men are alike or the same and in making him ashamed of the vanity that renders him insensible of the appropriate excellence which civil arrangements less unjust than might appear and nature illimitable in her bounty have conferred on men who may stand below him in the scale of society <\s>
<s> finally does it lie in establishing that dominion over the spirits of readers by which they are to be humbled and humanised in order that they may be purified and exalted <\s>
<s> if these ends are to be attained by the mere communication of knowledge it does not lie here taste i would remind the reader like imagination is a word which has been forced to extend its services far beyond the point to which philosophy would have confined them <\s>
<s> it is a metaphor taken from a passive sense of the human body and transferred to things which are in their essence not passive to intellectual acts and operations <\s>
<s> the word imagination has been overstrained from impulses honourable to mankind to meet the demands of the faculty which is perhaps the noblest of our nature <\s>
<s> in the instance of taste the process has been reversed and from the prevalence of dispositions at once injurious and discreditable being no other than that selfishness which is the child of apathy which as nations decline in productive and creative power makes them value themselves upon a presumed refinement of judging <\s>
<s> poverty of language is the primary cause of the use which we make of the word imagination but the word taste has been stretched to the sense which it bears in modern europe by habits of self conceit inducing that inversion in the order of things whereby a passive faculty is made paramount among the faculties conversant with the fine arts <\s>
<s> proportion and congruity the requisite knowledge being supposed are subjects upon which taste may be trusted it is competent to this office for in its intercourse with these the mind is passive and is affected painfully or pleasurably as by an instinct <\s>
<s> but the profound and the exquisite in feeling the lofty and universal in thought and imagination or in ordinary language the pathetic and the sublime are neither of them accurately speaking objects of a faculty which could ever without a sinking in the spirit of nations have been designated by the metaphor taste <\s>
<s> because without the exertion of a co operating power in the mind of the reader there can be no adequate sympathy with either of these emotions without this auxiliary impulse elevated or profound passion cannot exist <\s>
<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>

<s> passion it must be observed is derived from a word which signifies suffering but the connection which suffering has with effort with exertion and action is immediate and inseparable <\s>
<s> how strikingly is this property of human nature exhibited by the fact that in popular language to be in a passion is to be angry but anger in hasty words or blows itself discharges on its foes <\s>
<s> to be moved then by a passion is to be excited often to external and always to internal effort whether for the continuance and strengthening of the passion or for its suppression accordingly as the course which it takes may be painful or pleasurable <\s>
<s> if the latter the soul must contribute to its support or it never becomes vivid and soon languishes and dies <\s>
<s> and this brings us to the point <\s>
<s> if every great poet with whose writings men are familiar in the highest exercise of his genius before he can be thoroughly enjoyed has to call forth and to communicate power this service in a still greater degree falls upon an original writer at his first appearance in the world of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before of genius in the fine arts the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature <\s>
<s> genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown <\s>
<s> what is all this but an advance or a conquest made by the soul of the poet <\s>
<s> is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by his slaves <\s>
<s> no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight <\s>
<s> therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power of which knowledge is the effect and there lies the true difficulty <\s>
<s> as the pathetic participates of an animal sensation it might seem that if the springs of this emotion were genuine all men possessed of competent knowledge of the facts and circumstances would be instantaneously affected <\s>
<s> and doubtless in the works of every true poet will be found passages of that species of excellence which is proved by effects immediate and universal <\s>
<s> but there are emotions of the pathetic that are simple and direct and others that are complex and revolutionary some to which the heart yields with gentleness others against which it struggles with pride these varieties are infinite as the combinations of circumstance and the constitutions of character <\s>
<s> remember also that the medium through which in poetry the heart is to be affected is language a thing subject to endless fluctuations and arbitrary associations <\s>
<s> the genius of the poet melts these down for his purpose but they retain their shape and quality to him who is not capable of exerting within his own mind a corresponding energy <\s>
<s> there is also a meditative as well as a human pathos an enthusiastic as well as an ordinary sorrow a sadness that has its seat in the depths of reason to which the mind cannot sink gently of itself but to which it must descend by treading the steps of thought <\s>
<s> and for the sublime if we consider what are the cares that occupy the passing day and how remote is the practice and the course of life from the sources of sublimity in the soul of man can it be wondered that there is little existing preparation for a poet charged with a new mission to extend its kingdom and to augment and spread its enjoyments <\s>
<s> away then with the senseless iteration of the word popular applied to new works in poetry as if there were no test of excellence in this first of the fine arts but that all men should run after its productions as if urged by an appetite or constrained by a spell the qualities of writing best fitted for eager reception are either such as startle the world into attention by their audacity and extravagance or they are chiefly of a superficial kind lying upon the surfaces of manners or arising out of a selection and arrangement of incidents by which the mind is kept upon the stretch of curiosity and the fancy amused without the trouble of thought <\s>
<s> but in every thing which is to send the soul into herself to be admonished of her weakness or to be made conscious of her power wherever life and nature are described as operated upon by the creative or abstracting virtue of the imagination wherever the instinctive wisdom of antiquity and her heroic passions uniting in the heart of the poet with the meditative wisdom of later ages have produced that accord of sublimated humanity which is at once a history of the remote past and a prophetic enunciation of the remotest future there the poet must reconcile himself for a season to few and scattered hearers grand thoughts and shakspeare must often have sighed over this truth as they are most naturally and most fitly conceived in solitude so can they not be brought forth in the midst of plaudits without some violation of their sanctity <\s>
<s> go to a silent exhibition of the productions of the sister art and be convinced that the qualities which dazzle at first sight and kindle the admiration of the multitude are essentially different from those by which permanent influence is secured <\s>
<s> let us not shrink from following up these principles as far as they will carry us and conclude with observing that there never has been a period and perhaps never will be in which vicious poetry of some kind or other has not excited more zealous admiration and been far more generally read than good but this advantage attends the good that the individual as well as the species survives from age to age whereas of the depraved though the species be immortal the individual quickly perishes the object of present admiration vanishes being supplanted by some other as easily produced which though no better brings with it at least the irritation of novelty with adaptation more or less skilful to the changing humours of the majority of those who are most at leisure to regard poetical works when they first solicit their attention <\s>
<s> is it the result of the whole that in the opinion of the writer the judgment of the people is not to be respected <\s>
