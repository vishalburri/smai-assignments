<s> my dear wrangham i have this moment received your letter <\s>
<s> is a most provoking fellow very kind very humane very generous very ready to serve with a thousand other good qualities but in the practical business of life the arrantest marplan that ever lived <\s>
<s> when i first wrote to you i wrote also to him sending the statement which i sent to you and begging his exertions among his friends <\s>
<s> by and by comes back my statement having undergone a rifacimento from his hands and printed with an accompanying letter saying that if some of the principal people in this neighbourhood who had already subscribed would put their names to this paper testifying that this was a proper case for charitable interferences or that the persons mentioned were proper objects of charity that he would have the printed paper inserted in the public newspapers c <\s>
<s> upon which my sister wrote to him that in consequence of what had been already subscribed and what we had reason to expect from those friends who were privately stirring in the business among whom we chiefly alluded to you in our own minds as one on whom we had most dependence that there would be no necessity for public advertisements but that if among his private friends he could raise any money for us we should be very glad to receive it <\s>
<s> and upon this does he write to you in this what shall i call it <\s>
<s> for i am really vexed blundering manner <\s>
<s> i will not call upon you to undertake the awkward task of rebuilding that part of the edifice which has destroyed but let what remains be preserved and if a little could be added there would be no harm <\s>
<s> i must request you to transmit the money to me with the names of the persons to whom we are obliged <\s>
<s> with regard to the more important part of your letter i am under many difficulties <\s>
<s> i am writing from a window which gives me a view of a little boat gliding quietly about upon the surface of our basin of a lake <\s>
<s> i should like to be in it but what could i do with such a vessel in the heart of the atlantic ocean <\s>
<s> as this boat would be to that navigation so is my letter to the subject upon which you would set me afloat <\s>
<s> let me however say that i have read your sermon which i lately received from longman with much pleasure i only gave it a cursory perusal for since it arrived our family has been in great confusion we having removed to another house in which we are not yet half settled <\s>
<s> the appendix i had received before in a frank and of that i feel myself more entitled to speak because i had read it more at leisure <\s>
<s> i am entirely of accord with you in chiefly recommending religious books for the poor but of many of those which you recommend i can neither speak in praise nor blame as i have never read them <\s>
<s> yet as far as my own observation goes which has been mostly employed upon agricultural persons in thinly peopled districts i cannot find that there is much disposition to read among the labouring classes or much occasion for it <\s>
<s> among manufacturers and persons engaged in sedentary employments it is i know very different <\s>
<s> the labouring man in agriculture generally carries on his work either in solitude or with his own family with persons whose minds he is thoroughly acquainted with and with whom he is under no temptation to enter into discussions or to compare opinions <\s>
<s> he goes home from the field or the barn and within and about his own house he finds a hundred little jobs which furnish him with a change of employment which is grateful and profitable then comes supper and bed <\s>
<s> for sabbaths he goes to church with us often or mostly twice a day on coming home some one turns to the bible finds the text and probably reads the chapter whence it is taken or perhaps some other and in the afternoon the master or mistress frequently reads the bible if alone and on this day the mistress of the house almost always teaches the children to read or as they express it hears them a lesson or if not thus employed they visit their neighbours or receive them in their own houses as they drop in and keep up by the hour a slow and familiar chat <\s>
<s> this kind of life of which i have seen much and which i know would be looked upon with little complacency by many religious persons is peaceable and as innocent as the frame of society and the practices of government being what they are we have a right to expect besides it is much more intellectual than a careless observer would suppose <\s>
<s> one of our neighbours who lives as i have described was yesterday walking with me and as we were pacing on talking about indifferent matters by the side of a brook he suddenly said to me with great spirit and a lively smile i like to walk where i can hear the sound of a beck <\s>
<s> the word as you know in our dialect for a brook <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that this man without being conscious of it has had many devout feelings connected with the appearances which have presented themselves to him in his employment as a shepherd and that the pleasure of his heart at that moment was an acceptable offering to the divine being <\s>
<s> but to return to the subject of books <\s>
<s> i find among the people i am speaking of halfpenny ballads and penny and two penny histories in great abundance these are often bought as charitable tributes to the poor persons who hawk them about and it is the best way of procuring them <\s>
<s> they are frequently stitched together in tolerably thick volumes and such i have read some of the contents though not often religious very good others objectionable either for the superstition in them such as prophecies fortune telling c or more frequently for indelicacy <\s>
<s> i have so much felt the influence of these straggling papers that i have many a time wished that i had talents to produce songs poems and little histories that might circulate among other good things in this way supplanting partly the bad flowers and useless herbs and to take place of weeds <\s>
<s> indeed some of the poems which i have published were composed not without a hope that at some time or other they might answer this purpose <\s>
<s> the kind of library which you recommend would not i think for the reasons given above be of much direct use in any of the agricultural districts of cumberland and westmoreland with which i am acquainted though almost every person here can read i mean of general use as to morals or behaviour <\s>
<s> it might however with individuals do much in awakening enterprise calling forth ingenuity and fostering genius <\s>
<s> i have known several persons who would eagerly have sought not after these books merely but any books and would have been most happy in having such a collection to repair to <\s>
<s> the knowledge thus acquired would also have spread by being dealt about in conversation among their neighbours at the door and by the fire side so that it is not easy to foresee how far the good might extend and harm i can see none which would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantage <\s>
<s> the situation of manufacturers is deplorably different <\s>
<s> the monotony of their employments renders some sort of stimulus intellectual or bodily absolutely necessary for them <\s>
<s> their work is carried on in clusters men from different parts of the world and perpetually changing so that every individual is constantly in the way of being brought into contact with new notions and feelings and being unsettled in his own accordingly a select library therefore in such situations may be of the same use as a public dial keeping everybody's clock in some kind of order <\s>
<s> besides contrasting the manufacturer with the agriculturalist it may be observed that he has much more leisure and in his over hours not having other pleasant employment to turn to he is more likely to find reading a relief <\s>
<s> what then are the books which should be put in his way <\s>
<s> without being myself a clergyman i have no hesitation in saying chiefly religious ones though i should not go so far as you seemed inclined to do excluding others because they are not according to the letter or in the spirit of your profession <\s>
<s> i with you feel little disposed to admire several of those mentioned by gilbert burns much less others which you name as having been recommended <\s>
<s> in gilbert b s collection there may be too little religion and i should fear that you like all other clergymen may confine yourself too exclusively to that concern which you justly deem the most important but which by being exclusively considered can never be thoroughly understood <\s>
<s> i will allow with you that a religious faculty is the eye of the soul but if we would have successful soul oculists not merely that organ but the general anatomy and constitution of the intellectual frame must be studied for the powers of that eye are affected by the general state of the system <\s>
<s> my meaning is that piety and religion will be the best understood by him who takes the most comprehensive view of the human mind and that for the most part they will strengthen with the general strength of the mind and that this is best promoted by a due mixture of direct and indirect nourishment and discipline <\s>
<s> for example paradise lost and robinson crusoe might be as serviceable as law's serious call or melmoth's great importance of a religious life at least if the books be all good they would mutually assist each other <\s>
<s> in what i have said though following my own thoughts merely as called forth by your appendix is implied an answer to your request that i would give you half an idea upon education as a national object <\s>
<s> i have only kept upon the surface of the question but you must have deduced that i deem any plan of national education in a country like ours most difficult to apply to practice <\s>
<s> in switzerland or sweden or norway or france or spain or anywhere but great britain it would be comparatively easy <\s>
<s> heaven and hell are scarcely more different from each other than sheffield and manchester c differ from the plains and valleys of surrey essex cumberland or westmoreland <\s>
<s> we have mighty cities and towns of all sizes with villages and cottages scattered everywhere <\s>
<s> we are mariners miners manufacturers in tens of thousands traders husbandmen everything <\s>
<s> what form of discipline what books or doctrines i will not say would equally suit all these but which if happily fitted for one would not perhaps be an absolute nuisance in another <\s>
<s> you will also have deduced that nothing romantic can be said with truth of the influence of education upon the district in which i live <\s>
<s> we have thank heaven free schools or schools with some endowment almost everywhere and almost every one can read <\s>
<s> but not because we have free or endowed schools but because our land is far more than elsewhere tilled by men who are the owners of it and as the population is not over crowded and the vices which are quickened and cherished in a crowded population do not therefore prevail parents have more ability and inclination to send their children to school much more than in manufacturing districts and also though in a less degree more than in agricultural ones where the tillers are not proprietors <\s>
<s> if in scotland the children are sent to school where the parents have not the advantage i have been speaking of it is chiefly because their labour can be turned to no account at home <\s>
<s> send among them manufacturers or farmers on a large scale and you may indeed substitute sunday schools or other modes of instructing them but the ordinary parish schools will be neglected <\s>
<s> the influence of our schools in this neighbourhood can never be understood if this their connection with the state of landed property be overlooked <\s>
<s> in fact that influence is not striking <\s>
<s> the people are not habitually religious in the common sense of the word much less godly <\s>
<s> the effect of their schooling is chiefly seen by the activity with which the young persons emigrate and the success attending it and at home by a general orderliness and gravity with habits of independence and self respect nothing obsequious or fawning is ever to be seen amongst them <\s>
<s> it may be added that this ability from the two causes land and schools of giving their children instruction contributes to spread a respect for scholarship through the country <\s>
<s> if in any family one of the children should be quicker at his book or fonder of it than others he is often marked out in consequence for the profession of a clergyman <\s>
<s> this before the mercantile or manufacturing employments held out such flattering hopes very generally happened so that the schools of the north were the great nurseries of curates several of whom got forward in their profession some with and others without the help of a university education and in all instances such connection of families all the members of which lived in the humblest and plainest manner working with their own hands as labourers with a learned and dignified profession assisted and still does though in a less degree not a little to elevate their feelings and conferred importance on them in their own eyes <\s>
<s> but i must stop my dear wrangham <\s>
<s> begin your education at the top of society let the head go in the right course and the tail will follow <\s>
<s> but what can you expect of national education conducted by a government which for twenty years resisted the abolition of the slave trade and annually debauches the morals of the people by every possible device <\s>
<s> holding out temptation with one hand and scourging with the other <\s>
<s> the distilleries and lotteries are a standing record that the government cares nothing for the morals of the people and that all which they want is their money <\s>

<s> as this boat would be to that navigation so is my letter to the subject upon which you would set me afloat <\s>
<s> let me however say that i have read your sermon which i lately received from longman with much pleasure i only gave it a cursory perusal for since it arrived our family has been in great confusion we having removed to another house in which we are not yet half settled <\s>
<s> the appendix i had received before in a frank and of that i feel myself more entitled to speak because i had read it more at leisure <\s>
<s> i am entirely of accord with you in chiefly recommending religious books for the poor but of many of those which you recommend i can neither speak in praise nor blame as i have never read them <\s>
<s> yet as far as my own observation goes which has been mostly employed upon agricultural persons in thinly peopled districts i cannot find that there is much disposition to read among the labouring classes or much occasion for it <\s>
<s> among manufacturers and persons engaged in sedentary employments it is i know very different <\s>
<s> the labouring man in agriculture generally carries on his work either in solitude or with his own family with persons whose minds he is thoroughly acquainted with and with whom he is under no temptation to enter into discussions or to compare opinions <\s>
<s> he goes home from the field or the barn and within and about his own house he finds a hundred little jobs which furnish him with a change of employment which is grateful and profitable then comes supper and bed <\s>
<s> for sabbaths he goes to church with us often or mostly twice a day on coming home some one turns to the bible finds the text and probably reads the chapter whence it is taken or perhaps some other and in the afternoon the master or mistress frequently reads the bible if alone and on this day the mistress of the house almost always teaches the children to read or as they express it hears them a lesson or if not thus employed they visit their neighbours or receive them in their own houses as they drop in and keep up by the hour a slow and familiar chat <\s>
<s> this kind of life of which i have seen much and which i know would be looked upon with little complacency by many religious persons is peaceable and as innocent as the frame of society and the practices of government being what they are we have a right to expect besides it is much more intellectual than a careless observer would suppose <\s>
<s> one of our neighbours who lives as i have described was yesterday walking with me and as we were pacing on talking about indifferent matters by the side of a brook he suddenly said to me with great spirit and a lively smile i like to walk where i can hear the sound of a beck <\s>
<s> the word as you know in our dialect for a brook <\s>
<s> i cannot but think that this man without being conscious of it has had many devout feelings connected with the appearances which have presented themselves to him in his employment as a shepherd and that the pleasure of his heart at that moment was an acceptable offering to the divine being <\s>
<s> but to return to the subject of books <\s>
<s> i find among the people i am speaking of halfpenny ballads and penny and two penny histories in great abundance these are often bought as charitable tributes to the poor persons who hawk them about and it is the best way of procuring them <\s>
<s> they are frequently stitched together in tolerably thick volumes and such i have read some of the contents though not often religious very good others objectionable either for the superstition in them such as prophecies fortune telling c or more frequently for indelicacy <\s>
<s> i have so much felt the influence of these straggling papers that i have many a time wished that i had talents to produce songs poems and little histories that might circulate among other good things in this way supplanting partly the bad flowers and useless herbs and to take place of weeds <\s>
<s> indeed some of the poems which i have published were composed not without a hope that at some time or other they might answer this purpose <\s>
<s> the kind of library which you recommend would not i think for the reasons given above be of much direct use in any of the agricultural districts of cumberland and westmoreland with which i am acquainted though almost every person here can read i mean of general use as to morals or behaviour <\s>
<s> it might however with individuals do much in awakening enterprise calling forth ingenuity and fostering genius <\s>
<s> i have known several persons who would eagerly have sought not after these books merely but any books and would have been most happy in having such a collection to repair to <\s>
<s> the knowledge thus acquired would also have spread by being dealt about in conversation among their neighbours at the door and by the fire side so that it is not easy to foresee how far the good might extend and harm i can see none which would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantage <\s>
<s> the situation of manufacturers is deplorably different <\s>
<s> the monotony of their employments renders some sort of stimulus intellectual or bodily absolutely necessary for them <\s>
<s> their work is carried on in clusters men from different parts of the world and perpetually changing so that every individual is constantly in the way of being brought into contact with new notions and feelings and being unsettled in his own accordingly a select library therefore in such situations may be of the same use as a public dial keeping everybody's clock in some kind of order <\s>
<s> besides contrasting the manufacturer with the agriculturalist it may be observed that he has much more leisure and in his over hours not having other pleasant employment to turn to he is more likely to find reading a relief <\s>
<s> what then are the books which should be put in his way <\s>
<s> without being myself a clergyman i have no hesitation in saying chiefly religious ones though i should not go so far as you seemed inclined to do excluding others because they are not according to the letter or in the spirit of your profession <\s>
<s> i with you feel little disposed to admire several of those mentioned by gilbert burns much less others which you name as having been recommended <\s>
<s> in gilbert b s collection there may be too little religion and i should fear that you like all other clergymen may confine yourself too exclusively to that concern which you justly deem the most important but which by being exclusively considered can never be thoroughly understood <\s>
<s> i will allow with you that a religious faculty is the eye of the soul but if we would have successful soul oculists not merely that organ but the general anatomy and constitution of the intellectual frame must be studied for the powers of that eye are affected by the general state of the system <\s>
<s> my meaning is that piety and religion will be the best understood by him who takes the most comprehensive view of the human mind and that for the most part they will strengthen with the general strength of the mind and that this is best promoted by a due mixture of direct and indirect nourishment and discipline <\s>
<s> for example paradise lost and robinson crusoe might be as serviceable as law's serious call or melmoth's great importance of a religious life at least if the books be all good they would mutually assist each other <\s>
<s> in what i have said though following my own thoughts merely as called forth by your appendix is implied an answer to your request that i would give you half an idea upon education as a national object <\s>
<s> i have only kept upon the surface of the question but you must have deduced that i deem any plan of national education in a country like ours most difficult to apply to practice <\s>
<s> in switzerland or sweden or norway or france or spain or anywhere but great britain it would be comparatively easy <\s>
<s> heaven and hell are scarcely more different from each other than sheffield and manchester c differ from the plains and valleys of surrey essex cumberland or westmoreland <\s>
<s> we have mighty cities and towns of all sizes with villages and cottages scattered everywhere <\s>
<s> we are mariners miners manufacturers in tens of thousands traders husbandmen everything <\s>
<s> what form of discipline what books or doctrines i will not say would equally suit all these but which if happily fitted for one would not perhaps be an absolute nuisance in another <\s>
<s> you will also have deduced that nothing romantic can be said with truth of the influence of education upon the district in which i live <\s>
<s> we have thank heaven free schools or schools with some endowment almost everywhere and almost every one can read <\s>
<s> but not because we have free or endowed schools but because our land is far more than elsewhere tilled by men who are the owners of it and as the population is not over crowded and the vices which are quickened and cherished in a crowded population do not therefore prevail parents have more ability and inclination to send their children to school much more than in manufacturing districts and also though in a less degree more than in agricultural ones where the tillers are not proprietors <\s>
<s> if in scotland the children are sent to school where the parents have not the advantage i have been speaking of it is chiefly because their labour can be turned to no account at home <\s>
<s> send among them manufacturers or farmers on a large scale and you may indeed substitute sunday schools or other modes of instructing them but the ordinary parish schools will be neglected <\s>
<s> the influence of our schools in this neighbourhood can never be understood if this their connection with the state of landed property be overlooked <\s>
<s> in fact that influence is not striking <\s>
<s> the people are not habitually religious in the common sense of the word much less godly <\s>
<s> the effect of their schooling is chiefly seen by the activity with which the young persons emigrate and the success attending it and at home by a general orderliness and gravity with habits of independence and self respect nothing obsequious or fawning is ever to be seen amongst them <\s>
<s> it may be added that this ability from the two causes land and schools of giving their children instruction contributes to spread a respect for scholarship through the country <\s>
<s> if in any family one of the children should be quicker at his book or fonder of it than others he is often marked out in consequence for the profession of a clergyman <\s>
<s> this before the mercantile or manufacturing employments held out such flattering hopes very generally happened so that the schools of the north were the great nurseries of curates several of whom got forward in their profession some with and others without the help of a university education and in all instances such connection of families all the members of which lived in the humblest and plainest manner working with their own hands as labourers with a learned and dignified profession assisted and still does though in a less degree not a little to elevate their feelings and conferred importance on them in their own eyes <\s>
<s> but i must stop my dear wrangham <\s>
<s> begin your education at the top of society let the head go in the right course and the tail will follow <\s>
<s> but what can you expect of national education conducted by a government which for twenty years resisted the abolition of the slave trade and annually debauches the morals of the people by every possible device <\s>
<s> holding out temptation with one hand and scourging with the other <\s>
<s> the distilleries and lotteries are a standing record that the government cares nothing for the morals of the people and that all which they want is their money <\s>
<s> but wisdom and justice are the only true sources of the revenue of a people preach this and may you not preach in vain <\s>
<s> wishing you success in every good work i remain your affectionate friend w <\s>

<s> my dear sir i have read your excellent sermons delivered before the university 31 several times <\s>
<s> in nothing were my notions different from yours as there expressed <\s>
<s> it happened that i had been reading just before bishop bull's sermon 32 of which you speak so highly it had struck me just in the same way as an inestimable production <\s>
<s> i was highly gratified by your discourses and cannot but think that they must have been beneficial to the hearers there abounds in them so pure a fervour <\s>
<s> i have as yet bestowed less attention upon your german controversy 33 than so important a subject deserves <\s>

<s> since our conversation upon the subject of education i have found no reason to alter the opinions i then expressed <\s>
<s> of those who seem to me to be in error two parties are especially prominent they the most conspicuous head of whom is mr <\s>
<s> brougham who think that sharpening of intellect and attainment of knowledge are things good in themselves without reference to the circumstances under which the intellect is sharpened or to the quality of the knowledge acquired <\s>
<s> knowledge says lord bacon is power but surely not less for evil than for good <\s>
<s> lord bacon spoke like a philosopher but they who have that maxim in their mouths the oftenest have the least understanding of it <\s>
<s> the other class consists of persons who are aware of the importance of religion and morality above everything but from not understanding the constitution of our nature and the composition of society they are misled and hurried on by zeal in a course which cannot but lead to disappointment <\s>
<s> one instance of this fell under my own eyes the other day in the little town of ambleside where a party the leaders of which are young ladies are determined to set up a school for girls on the madras system confidently expecting that these girls will in consequence be less likely to go astray when they grow up to women <\s>
<s> they may be taught i own more quickly to read and write under the madras system and to answer more readily and perhaps with more intelligence questions put to them than they could have done under dame teaching <\s>
<s> but poetry may with deference to the philosopher and the religionist be consulted in these matters and i will back shenstone's school mistress by her winter fire and in her summer garden seat against all dr <\s>
