<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>

<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>

<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>

<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> all strength all terror single or in bands that ever was put forth in personal form jehovah with his thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the empyreal thrones i pass them unalarmed <\s>
<s> not chaos not the darkest pit of lowest erebus nor aught of blinder vacancy scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe as fall upon us often when we look into our minds into the mind of man my haunt and the main region of my song <\s>
<s> beauty a living presence of the earth surpassing the most fair ideal forms which craft of delicate spirits hath composed from earth's materials waits upon my steps pitches her tents before me as i move an hourly neighbour <\s>
<s> paradise and groves elysian fortunate fields like those of old sought in the atlantic main why should they be a history only of departed things or a mere fiction of what never was <\s>
<s> for the discerning intellect of man when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion shall find these a simple produce of the common day <\s>
<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>
<s> such grateful haunts foregoing if i oft must turn elsewhere to travel near the tribes and fellowships of men and see ill sights of madding passions mutually inflamed must hear humanity in fields and groves pipe solitary anguish or must hang brooding above the fierce confederate storm of sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities may these sounds have their authentic comment that even these hearing i be not downcast or forlorn descend prophetic spirit <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>

<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>

<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> grasmere 14th october 1803 <\s>
<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> for i must tread on shadowy ground must sink deep and aloft ascending breathe in worlds to which the heaven of heavens is but a veil <\s>
<s> all strength all terror single or in bands that ever was put forth in personal form jehovah with his thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the empyreal thrones i pass them unalarmed <\s>
<s> not chaos not the darkest pit of lowest erebus nor aught of blinder vacancy scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe as fall upon us often when we look into our minds into the mind of man my haunt and the main region of my song <\s>
<s> beauty a living presence of the earth surpassing the most fair ideal forms which craft of delicate spirits hath composed from earth's materials waits upon my steps pitches her tents before me as i move an hourly neighbour <\s>
<s> paradise and groves elysian fortunate fields like those of old sought in the atlantic main why should they be a history only of departed things or a mere fiction of what never was <\s>
<s> for the discerning intellect of man when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion shall find these a simple produce of the common day <\s>
<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>
<s> such grateful haunts foregoing if i oft must turn elsewhere to travel near the tribes and fellowships of men and see ill sights of madding passions mutually inflamed must hear humanity in fields and groves pipe solitary anguish or must hang brooding above the fierce confederate storm of sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities may these sounds have their authentic comment that even these hearing i be not downcast or forlorn descend prophetic spirit <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>
<s> thus shall our healths do others good whilst we ourselves do all we would for freed from envy and from care what would we be but what we are <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> grasmere 14th october 1803 <\s>
<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> for i must tread on shadowy ground must sink deep and aloft ascending breathe in worlds to which the heaven of heavens is but a veil <\s>
<s> all strength all terror single or in bands that ever was put forth in personal form jehovah with his thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the empyreal thrones i pass them unalarmed <\s>
<s> not chaos not the darkest pit of lowest erebus nor aught of blinder vacancy scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe as fall upon us often when we look into our minds into the mind of man my haunt and the main region of my song <\s>
<s> beauty a living presence of the earth surpassing the most fair ideal forms which craft of delicate spirits hath composed from earth's materials waits upon my steps pitches her tents before me as i move an hourly neighbour <\s>
<s> paradise and groves elysian fortunate fields like those of old sought in the atlantic main why should they be a history only of departed things or a mere fiction of what never was <\s>
<s> for the discerning intellect of man when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion shall find these a simple produce of the common day <\s>
<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>
<s> such grateful haunts foregoing if i oft must turn elsewhere to travel near the tribes and fellowships of men and see ill sights of madding passions mutually inflamed must hear humanity in fields and groves pipe solitary anguish or must hang brooding above the fierce confederate storm of sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities may these sounds have their authentic comment that even these hearing i be not downcast or forlorn descend prophetic spirit <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>
<s> thus shall our healths do others good whilst we ourselves do all we would for freed from envy and from care what would we be but what we are <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> grasmere 14th october 1803 <\s>
<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> for i must tread on shadowy ground must sink deep and aloft ascending breathe in worlds to which the heaven of heavens is but a veil <\s>
<s> all strength all terror single or in bands that ever was put forth in personal form jehovah with his thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the empyreal thrones i pass them unalarmed <\s>
<s> not chaos not the darkest pit of lowest erebus nor aught of blinder vacancy scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe as fall upon us often when we look into our minds into the mind of man my haunt and the main region of my song <\s>
<s> beauty a living presence of the earth surpassing the most fair ideal forms which craft of delicate spirits hath composed from earth's materials waits upon my steps pitches her tents before me as i move an hourly neighbour <\s>
<s> paradise and groves elysian fortunate fields like those of old sought in the atlantic main why should they be a history only of departed things or a mere fiction of what never was <\s>
<s> for the discerning intellect of man when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion shall find these a simple produce of the common day <\s>
<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>
<s> such grateful haunts foregoing if i oft must turn elsewhere to travel near the tribes and fellowships of men and see ill sights of madding passions mutually inflamed must hear humanity in fields and groves pipe solitary anguish or must hang brooding above the fierce confederate storm of sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities may these sounds have their authentic comment that even these hearing i be not downcast or forlorn descend prophetic spirit <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>
<s> thus shall our healths do others good whilst we ourselves do all we would for freed from envy and from care what would we be but what we are <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>

<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> grasmere 14th october 1803 <\s>
<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>
<s> though myself a water drinker i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing what follows as an instance still more happy of fancy employed in the treatment of feeling than in its preceding passages the poem supplies of her management of forms <\s>
<s> tis that that gives the poet rage and thaws the gelly'd blood of age matures the young restores the old and makes the fainting coward bold <\s>
<s> it lays the careful head to rest calms palpitations in the breast <\s>
<s> renders our lives misfortune sweet then let the chill sirocco blow and gird us round with hills of snow or else go whistle to the shore and make the hollow mountains roar <\s>
<s> whilst we together jovial sit careless and crowned with mirth and wit where though bleak winds confine us home our fancies round the world shall roam <\s>
<s> we'll think of all the friends we know <\s>
<s> and drink to all worth drinking to when having drunk all thine and mine we rather shall want healths than wine <\s>
<s> but where friends fail us we'll supply our friendships with our charity men that remote in sorrows live shall by our lusty brimmers thrive <\s>
<s> we'll drink the wanting into wealth and those that languish into health the afflicted into joy th opprest into security and rest <\s>
<s> the worthy in disgrace shall find favour return again more kind and in restraint who stifled lie shall taste the air of liberty <\s>
<s> the brave shall triumph in success the lovers shall have mistresses poor unregarded virtue praise and the neglected poet bays <\s>

<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>

<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>

<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>

<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>

<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>

<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>

<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>

<s> dear sir george if any person were to be informed of the particulars of your kindness to me if it were described to him in all its delicacy and nobleness and he should afterwards be told that i suffered eight weeks to elapse without writing to you one word of thanks or acknowledgment he would deem it a thing absolutely impossible <\s>
<s> it is nevertheless true <\s>
<s> this is in fact the first time that i have taken up a pen not for writing letters but on any account whatsoever except once since mr <\s>
<s> coleridge showed me the writings of the applethwaite estate and told me the little history of what you had done for me the motives c <\s>
<s> i need not say that it gave me the most heartfelt pleasure not for my own sake chiefly though in that point of view it might well be most highly interesting to me but as an act which considered in all its relations as to matter and manner it would not be too much to say did honour to human nature at least i felt it as such and it overpowered me <\s>
<s> owing to a set of painful and uneasy sensations which i have more or less at all times about my chest from a disease which chiefly affects my nerves and digestive organs and which makes my aversion from writing little less than madness i deferred writing to you being at first made still more uncomfortable by travelling and loathing to do violence to myself in what ought to be an act of pure pleasure and enjoyment viz the expression of my deep sense of your goodness <\s>
<s> this feeling was indeed so strong in me as to make me look upon the act of writing to you not as the work of a moment but as a business with something little less than awful in it a task a duty a thing not to be done but in my best my purest and my happiest moments <\s>
<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> and if bearing in mind the many poets distinguished by this prime quality whose names i omit to mention yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant the incapable and the presumptuous have heaped upon these and my other writings i may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself i shall declare censurable i grant if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me that i have given in these unfavourable times evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects the external universe the moral and religious sentiments of man his natural affections and his acquired passions which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men in this kind worthy to be holden in undying remembrance <\s>
<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>

<s> many of these i had but then i had not my pen and ink and my paper before me my conveniences my appliances and means to boot all which the moment that i thought of them seemed to disturb and impair the sanctity of my pleasure <\s>
<s> i contented myself with thinking over my complacent feelings and breathing forth solitary gratulations and thanksgivings which i did in many a sweet and many a wild place during my late tour <\s>
<s> in this shape procrastination became irresistible to me at last i said i will write at home from my own fire side when i shall be at ease and in comfort <\s>
<s> i have now been more than a fortnight at home but the uneasiness in my chest has made me beat off the time when the pen was to be taken up <\s>
<s> i do not know from what cause it is but during the last three years i have never had a pen in my hand for five minutes before my whole frame becomes one bundle of uneasiness a perspiration starts out all over me and my chest is oppressed in a manner which i cannot describe <\s>
<s> this is a sad weakness for i am sure though it is chiefly owing to the state of my body that by exertion of mind i might in part control it <\s>
<s> so however it is and i mention it because i am sure when you are made acquainted with the circumstances though the extent to which it exists nobody can well conceive you will look leniently upon my silence and rather pity than blame me though i must still continue to reproach myself as i have done bitterly every day for these last eight weeks <\s>
<s> one thing in particular has given me great uneasiness it is least in the extreme delicacy of your mind which is well known to me you for a moment may have been perplexed by a single apprehension that there might be any error anything which i might misconceive in your kindness to me <\s>
<s> when i think of the possibility of this i am vexed beyond measure that i had not resolution to write immediately <\s>
<s> but i hope that these fears are all groundless and that you have as i know your nature will lead you to do suspended your judgment upon my silence blaming me indeed but in that qualified way in which a good man blames what he believes will be found an act of venial infirmity when it is fully explained <\s>
<s> but i have troubled you far too much with this <\s>
<s> such i am however and deeply i regret that i am such <\s>
<s> i shall conclude with solemnly assuring you late as it is that nothing can wear out of my heart as long as my faculties remain the deep feeling which i have of your delicate and noble conduct towards me <\s>
<s> this abhorrence was almost as strong in our great epic poet both from circumstances of his life and from the constitution of his mind <\s>
<s> however imbued the surface might be with classical literature he was a hebrew in soul and all things tended in him towards the sublime <\s>
<s> spenser of a gentler nature maintained his freedom by aid of his allegorical spirit at one time inciting him to create persons out of abstractions and at another by a superior effort of genius to give the universality and permanence of abstractions to his human beings by means of attributes and emblems that belong to the highest moral truths and the purest sensations of which his character of una is a glorious example <\s>

<s> to the mode in which fancy has already been characterised as the power of evoking and combining or as my friend mr <\s>
<s> coleridge has styled it the aggregative and associative power my objection is only that the definition is too general <\s>
<s> to aggregate and to associate to evoke and to combine belong as well to the imagination as to the fancy but either the materials evoked and combined are different or they are brought together under a different law and for a different purpose <\s>
<s> fancy does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be susceptible of change in their constitution from her touch and where they admit of modification it is enough for her purpose if it be slight limited and evanescent <\s>
<s> directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the imagination <\s>
<s> she recoils from everything but the plastic the pliant and the indefinite <\s>
<s> she leaves it to fancy to describe queen mab as coming in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman <\s>
<s> having to speak of stature she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall as pompey's pillar much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits high or that his dimensions equalled those of teneriffe or atlas because these and if they were a million times as high it would be the same are bounded the expression is his stature reached the sky <\s>
<s> the illimitable firmament when the imagination frames a comparison if it does not strike on the first presentation a sense of the truth of the likeness from the moment that it is perceived grows and continues to grow upon the mind the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression and effect less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties moreover the images invariably modify each other the law under which the processes of fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things and the effects are surprising playful ludicrous amusing tender or pathetic as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined <\s>
<s> fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images trusting that their number and the felicity with which they are linked together will make amends for the want of individual value or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities <\s>
<s> if she can win you over to her purpose and impart to you her feelings she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion <\s>
<s> but the imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion the soul may fall away from it not being able to sustain its grandeur but if once felt and acknowledged by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed impaired or diminished fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature imagination to incite and to support the eternal yet is it not the less true that fancy as she is an active is also under her own laws and in her own spirit a creative faculty <\s>
<s> in what manner fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with imagination and imagination stoops to work with materials of fancy might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers whether in prose or verse and chiefly from those of our own country <\s>
<s> scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of bishop taylor's works can be opened that shall not afford examples referring the reader to those inestimable volumes i will content myself with placing a conceit ascribed to lord chesterfield in contrast with a passage from the paradise lost the dews of the evening most carefully shun they are the tears of the sky for the loss of the sun <\s>
<s> after the transgression of adam milton with other appearances of sympathising nature thus marks the immediate consequence sky lowered and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completion of the mortal sin <\s>
<s> the associating link is the same in each instance dew and rain not distinguishable from the liquid substance of tears are employed as indications of sorrow <\s>
<s> a flash of surprise is the effect in the former case a flash of surprise and nothing more for the nature of things does not sustain the combination <\s>
<s> in the latter the effects from the act of which there is this immediate consequence and visible sign are so momentous that the mind acknowledges the justice and reasonableness of the sympathy in nature so manifested and the sky weeps drops of water as if with human eyes as earth had before trembled from her entrails and nature given a second groan <\s>
<s> finally i will refer to cotton's ode upon winter an admirable composition though stained with some peculiarities of the age in which he lived for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy <\s>
<s> the middle part of this ode contains a most lively description of the entrance of winter with his retinue as a palsied king and yet a military monarch advancing for conquest with his army the several bodies of which and their arms and equipments are described with a rapidity of detail and a profusion of fanciful comparisons which indicate on the part of the poet extreme activity of intellect and a correspondent hurry of delightful feeling <\s>
<s> winter retires from the foe into his fortress where a magazine of sovereign juice is cellared in liquor that will the siege maintain should phoebus ne'er return again <\s>

<s> e of the excursion <\s>
<s> the title page announces that this is only a portion of a poem and the reader must be here apprised that it belongs to the second part of a long and laborious work which is to consist of three parts the author will candidly acknowledge that if the first of these had been completed and in such a manner as to satisfy his own mind he should have preferred the natural order of publication and have given that to the world first but as the second division of the work was designed to refer more to passing events and to an existing state of things than the others were meant to do more continuous exertion was naturally bestowed upon it and greater progress made here than in the rest of the poem and as this part does not depend upon the preceding to a degree which will materially injure its own peculiar interest the author complying with the earnest entreaties of some valued friends presents the following pages to the public <\s>
<s> it may be proper to state whence the poem of which the excursion is a part derives its title of the recluse several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him for such employment <\s>
<s> as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them <\s>
<s> that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the ante chapel has to the body of a gothic church <\s>
<s> continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices <\s>
<s> the author would not have deemed himself justified in saying upon this occasion so much of performances either unfinished or unpublished if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he has heretofore and now laid before the public entitled him to candid attention for such a statement as he thinks necessary to throw light upon his endeavours to please and he would hope to benefit his countrymen nothing further need be added than that the first and third parts of the recluse will consist chiefly of meditations in the author's own person and that in the intermediate part the excursion the intervention of characters speaking is employed and something of a dramatic form adopted <\s>
<s> it is not the author's intention formally to announce a system it was more animating to him to proceed in a different course and if he shall succeed in conveying to the mind clear thoughts lively images and strong feelings the reader will have no difficulty in extracting the system for himself <\s>
<s> and in the mean time the following passage taken from the conclusion of the first book of the recluse may be acceptable as a kind of prospectus of the design and scope of the whole poem <\s>
<s> on man on nature and on human life musing in solitude i oft perceive fair trains of imagery before me rise <\s>
<s> accompanied by feelings of delight pure or with no unpleasing sadness mixed and i am conscious of affecting thoughts and dear remembrances whose presence soothes or elevates the mind intent to weigh the good and evil of our mortal state <\s>
<s> to these emotions whencesoe'er they come whether from breath of outward circumstance or from the soul an impulse to herself i would give utterance in numerous verse <\s>
<s> of truth of grandeur beauty love and hope and melancholy fear subdued by faith of blessed consolations in distress of moral strength and intellectual power of joy in widest commonalty spread of the individual mind that keeps her own inviolate retirement subject there to conscience only and the law supreme of that intelligence which governs all i sing fit audience let me find though few <\s>

<s> urania i shall need thy guidance or a greater muse if such descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven <\s>
<s> for i must tread on shadowy ground must sink deep and aloft ascending breathe in worlds to which the heaven of heavens is but a veil <\s>
<s> all strength all terror single or in bands that ever was put forth in personal form jehovah with his thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the empyreal thrones i pass them unalarmed <\s>
<s> not chaos not the darkest pit of lowest erebus nor aught of blinder vacancy scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe as fall upon us often when we look into our minds into the mind of man my haunt and the main region of my song <\s>
<s> beauty a living presence of the earth surpassing the most fair ideal forms which craft of delicate spirits hath composed from earth's materials waits upon my steps pitches her tents before me as i move an hourly neighbour <\s>
<s> paradise and groves elysian fortunate fields like those of old sought in the atlantic main why should they be a history only of departed things or a mere fiction of what never was <\s>
<s> for the discerning intellect of man when wedded to this goodly universe in love and holy passion shall find these a simple produce of the common day <\s>
<s> i long before the blissful hour arrives would chant in lonely peace the spousal verse of this great consummation and by words which speak of nothing more than what we are would i arouse the sensual from their sleep of death and win the vacant and the vain to noble raptures while my voice proclaims how exquisitely the individual mind and the progressive powers perhaps no less of the whole species to the external world is fitted and how exquisitely too theme this but little heard of among men the external world is fitted to the mind and the creation by no lower name can it be called which they with blended might accomplish this is our high argument <\s>
<s> such grateful haunts foregoing if i oft must turn elsewhere to travel near the tribes and fellowships of men and see ill sights of madding passions mutually inflamed must hear humanity in fields and groves pipe solitary anguish or must hang brooding above the fierce confederate storm of sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities may these sounds have their authentic comment that even these hearing i be not downcast or forlorn descend prophetic spirit <\s>
