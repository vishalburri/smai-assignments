<s> having undertaken a great feat for me to ride my daughter's pony from westmoreland to cambridge that she might have the use of it while on a visit to her uncle at trinity lodge on my way from bakewell to matlock i turned aside to chatsworth and had scarcely gratified my curiosity by the sight of that celebrated place before there came on a severe storm of wind and rain which continued till i reached derby both man and pony in a pitiable plight <\s>
