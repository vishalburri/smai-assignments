<s> i stumbled on him with proof sheets before him <\s>
<s> he read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of the castle of indolence 241 describing himself and my uncle and he and mrs <\s>

<s> 241 poems founded on the affections <\s>
<s> this rock was about a mile beyond wythburn chapel to which they used to accompany my uncle in going to keswick from grasmere and where they would meet him when he returned <\s>
<s> this led him to read much of the waggoner to me <\s>
<s> it seems a very favourite poem of his and he read me splendid descriptions from it <\s>
<s> he said his object in it had not been understood <\s>
<s> it was a play of the fancy on a domestic incident and lowly character he wished by the opening descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he wished it to be read <\s>
<s> if he failed in doing that he wished him to lay it down <\s>
<s> he pointed out with the same view the glowing lines on the state of exultation in which ben and his companions are under the influence of liquor <\s>
<s> then he read the sickening languor of the morning walk contrasted with the glorious uprising of nature and the songs of the birds <\s>
<s> here he has added about six most exquisite lines <\s>
<s> we walked out on the turf terrace on the loughrigg side of rydal water <\s>
<s> most exquisitely did the lake and opposite bank look <\s>
<s> thence he led me home under loughrigg through lovely spots i had never seen before <\s>
<s> his conversation was on critical subjects arising out of his attempts to alter his poems <\s>
<s> he said he considered the white doe as in conception the highest work he had ever produced <\s>
<s> the mere physical action was all unsuccessful but the true action of the poem was spiritual the subduing of the will and all inferior passions to the perfect purifying and spiritualising of the intellectual nature while the doe by connection with emily is raised as it were from its mere animal nature into something mysterious and saint like <\s>
<s> he said he should devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the mere business parts in which from anxiety to get on with the more important parts he was sensible that imperfections had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of character <\s>
<s> he talked of milton and observed how he sometimes indulged himself in the paradise lost in lines which if not in time you could hardly call verse instancing and tiresias and phineus prophets old and then noticed the sweet flowing lines which followed and with regard to which he had no doubt the unmusical line before had been inserted <\s>
<s> paradise regained he thought the most perfect in execution of anything written by milton that and the merchant of venice in language he thought were almost faultless with the exception of some little straining in some of the speeches about the caskets he said they were perfect the genuine english expressions of the ideas of their own great minds <\s>
<s> thomson he spoke of as a real poet though it appeared less in his seasons than in his other poems <\s>
<s> he had wanted some judicious adviser to correct his taste but every person he had to deal with only served to injure it <\s>
<s> he had however a true love and feeling for nature and a greater share of poetical imagination as distinguished from dramatic than any man between milton and him <\s>
<s> as he stood looking at ambleside seen across the valley embosomed in wood and separated from us at sufficient distance he quoted from thomson's hymn on solitude and suggested the addition or rather insertion of a line at the close where he speaks of glancing at london from norwood <\s>
<s> the line he said should have given something of a more favourable impression ambition 242 and pleasure vain <\s>
<s> october 14th foxhow we have had a delightful day to day <\s>
<s> the weather being fine wordsworth agreed to go with us into easedale so we got three ponies for mary and madge and fred and alley alternately and walked from grasmere he trudging 243 before with his green gauze shade over his eyes and in his plaid jacket and waistcoat <\s>

<s> a beautiful water break of the same stream was before us at our feet and he noticed the connection which it formed in the landscape with the distant waterfall <\s>
<s> then as he mused for an instant he said i have often thought what a solemn thing it would be if we could have brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery which any spot however beautiful and calm before us has been witness to since the beginning <\s>

<s> in time she saw the backs of cattle feeding which emerged from the darkness and at last the tarn and then found she had stopped providentially and was sitting nearly on the edge of the precipice <\s>
